大寶積經

文殊師利普門會

The Universal Gateway of Mañjuśrī

如是我聞：

Thus have I heard:

一時佛在王舍城耆闍崛山中，與大比丘眾八百人俱，菩薩摩訶薩四萬二千。時有菩薩名無垢藏，與九萬二千諸菩薩眾，恭敬圍遶從空而來。爾時世尊即告大眾：「彼諸菩薩，為遍清淨行世界普花如來勸發，來此娑婆世界，令於我所聽受普入不思議法門；其諸菩薩亦當集會。」說是語已，無量無邊他方此界諸菩薩眾，悉來集會耆闍崛山，頂禮佛足却住一面。

Once the Buddha was dwelling on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa near Rājagṛha, accompanied by eight hundred great *bhikṣus* and forty-two thousand bodhisattvas. At that time, a bodhisattva named  Amalagarbha (’Undefiled Matrix’) descended from the sky, surrounded respectfully by ninety-two thousand other Bodhisattvas. Then the World-Honored One told the assembly, "These Bodhisattvas were urged by Saṃkusumita (Universal Flower) Tathāgata, in the world called Every Pure Deed, to come to this Sahā World in order to hear and receive from me entry into an inconceivable Dharma Door." After the World-Honored One had finished saying this, innumerable Bodhisattvas came from this and other worlds and gathered on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa. After prostrating themselves with their heads at the Buddha's feet, they withdrew and stood to one side.

爾時無垢藏菩薩手持七寶千葉蓮花，至如來所頭面禮足，白佛言：「世尊！遍清淨行世界普花如來，以是寶花奉上世尊。致問無量，少病少惱、起居輕利、安樂行不？」作是語已，即昇虛空結加趺坐。

Then Bodhisattva Undefiled Store approached the Tathāgata, bearing in his hand a thousand-petalled lotus flower made of the seven treasures. He bowed down with his head at the Buddha's feet and said, "World-Honored One! Universal Flower Tathagata in the world called Every Pure Deed offers you this precious flower and asks me to convey to you his infinite good wishes. He inquires whether you are enjoying good health, freedom from afflictions, and ease and peace in life." After saying this, the Bodhisattva ascended in midair and sat there in the position of meditation.

爾時文殊師利菩薩摩訶薩，於大眾中即從座起，偏袒右肩右膝著地，合掌恭敬而白佛言：「我念過去久遠世時，曾於普燈佛所聞說普入不思議法門。我於爾時即便獲得八千四百億那由他三昧，又能了知七十七萬億那由他三昧。善哉世尊！願垂哀愍為諸菩薩說此法門。」

At that time Mañjuśrī bodhisattva mahāsattva arose from his seat among the great assembly, bared his right shoulder, knelt on his right knee, joined his palms respectfully, and said to the Buddha, "I remember that very long ago I heard Universal Lamp Buddha explain entry into an inconceivable Dharma Door. Right then, I acquired eight hundred forty billion myriads of *samādhis*, and was able to know seventy-seven trillion myriads of *samādhis*. Excellent World-Honored One! May you, out of compassion for the Bodhisattvas, explain this dharma door to them."

爾時佛告文殊師利：「汝今諦聽，善思念之，當為汝說。」

Then the Buddha told Mañjuśrī, “Now, listen attentively and think well about this. I am going to explain it to you."

文殊師利言：「唯然世尊！願樂欲聞。」

Mañjuśrī said, “Yes, World-Honored One! We shall gladly listen.”

佛言：「若諸菩薩欲學此法，應當修習諸三昧門。所謂色相三昧、聲相三昧、香相三昧、味相三昧、觸相三昧、意界三昧、女相三昧、男相三昧、童男相三昧、童女相三昧、天相三昧、龍相三昧、夜叉相三昧、乾闥婆相三昧、阿修羅相三昧、迦樓羅相三昧、緊那羅相三昧、摩睺羅伽相三昧、地獄相三昧、畜生相三昧、閻魔羅界三昧、貪相三昧、瞋相三昧、癡相三昧、不善法三昧、善法三昧、有為三昧、無為三昧。

The Buddha said, "If bodhisattvas wish to learn this Dharma, they should cultivate these *samādhi* gateways. They are: the Characteristic of Form *Samādhi*, the Characteristic of Sound *Samādhi*, the Characteristic of Scent *Samādhi*, the Characteristic of Flavor *Samādhi*, the Characteristic of Tactility *Samādhi*, the Characteristic of Thought *Samādhi*, the Characteristic of Woman *Samādhi*, the Characteristic of Man *Samādhi*, the Characteristic of Boy *Samādhi*, the Characteristic of Girl *Samādhi*, the Characteristic of Deva *Samādhi*, the Characteristic of Nāga *Samādhi,* the Characteristic of Yakṣa *Samādhi*, the Characteristic of Gandharva *Samādhi*, the Characteristic of Asura *Samādhi*, the Characteristic of Garuḍa *Samādhi*, the Characteristic of Kinnara *Samādhi,* the Characteristic of Mahoraga *Samādhi,* the Characteristic of Naraka *Samādhi* (’Hell Dweller’), the Characteristic of Animal *Samādhi* (*tiryagyoni*), the Characteristic of Yama World *Samādhi*, the Characteristic of Desire (*rāga*) *Samādhi,* the Characteristic of Anger *Samādhi*, the Characteristic of Delusion *Samādhi*, the Characteristic of Wholesome Dharma *Samādhi*, the Characteristic of Unwholesome Dharma *Samādhi,* the Characteristic of the Conditioned *Samādhi*, and the Characteristic of the Unconditioned *Samādhi*.”         **

文殊師利！若諸菩薩於如是等一切三昧善通達者，是則已為修學此法。文殊師利！云何名為色相三昧？即說頌曰：

“Mañjuśrī! If bodhisattvas realize all these *samādhis*, they have already learned this Dharma. Mañjuśrī! What is the Characteristic of Form *Samādhi*?" Then he spoke in verse saying:

觀色如聚沫，　　
中無有堅實，　
不可執持故，　　
是名色三昧。

Observe form to be like foam,
Within which there is nothing firm or solid,
Because there is nothing to be attached to
It is called the Form *Samādhi*

「復次文殊師利！云何名為聲相三昧？即說頌曰：

“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! What is the Characteristic of Sound *Samādhi*?” Then he spoke in verse saying:

觀聲如谷響，　　
其性不可得，　
諸法亦如是，　　
無相無差別，　
了知皆寂靜，　　
是名聲三昧。

Observe sound(s) to be like echoes in a valley,
Their nature cannot be found;
All dharmas are also like this,
Without characteristics, without differentiation;
Knowing their quiescence,
Is called the Sound *Samādhi.*

「復次文殊師利！云何名為香相三昧？即說頌曰：

“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! What is the Characteristic of Scent *Samādhi*?” Then he spoke in verse saying:

假令百千劫，　　
常嗅種種香，　
如海納眾流，　　
而無有厭足。

Even if for hundreds of thousands of *kalpas*,
One constantly smelled various scents,
It’s just like the ocean taking in all rivers,
It will never be full.

其香若是實，　　
則應可滿足，　
但有假名字，　　
其實不可取。

If these scents were real,
One would soon have their fill,
Yet, because they are mere conventional names,
Their reality cannot be grasped.

以不可取故，　　
鼻亦無所有，　
了知性空寂，　　
是名香三昧。

Because they are ungraspable
The nose, too, has no existence;
Knowing their nature is empty and quiescent,
Is called the Scent *Samādhi*.

「復次文殊師利！云何名為味相三昧？即說頌曰：

“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! What is the Characteristic of Flavor *Samādhi*?” Then he spoke in verse saying:

舌根之所受，　　
鹹醋等諸味，　
皆從眾緣生，　　
其性無所有。

What is tasted by the tongue,
Salty, sour, and other flavors,
Arises dependent upon the person,
Their nature lacks existence.

若能如是知，　　
因緣和合起，　
了此不思議，　　
是名味三昧。

If one is able to know, like this,
Arising based upon causes and conditions,
This understanding is inconceivable,
And is called the Flavor *Samādhi*.

「復次文殊師利！云何名為觸相三昧？即說頌曰：

“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! What is the Characteristic of Tactility *Samādhi*?” Then he spoke in verse saying:

觸但有名字，　　
其性不可得，　
細滑等諸法，　　
皆是從緣生。

‘Touch’ is just a name,
The nature of which cannot be found,
Soft, smooth, and other things
They all arise from dependencies.

若能知觸性，　　
因緣和合起，　
畢竟無所有，　　
是名觸三昧。

If one if able to know the nature of touch,
Arising based upon causes and conditions,
Ultimately without existence,
This is called the Touch *Samādhi*

「復次文殊師利！云何名為意界三昧？即說頌曰：

“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! What is the Characteristic of Thought *Samādhi*?” Then he spoke in verse saying:

設集三千界，　　
無量諸眾生，　
一心共思求，　　
意界不可得。

Gathering from throughout the three thousand world-systems,
Immeasurable sentient beings
All single-mindedly seeking thoughts,
Yet the mental realm cannot be found.

不在於內外，　　
亦不可聚集，　
但以於假名，　　
說有種種相。

Thoughts are neither internal nor external,
Nor can they be gathered together.
They are merely conventional designations,
Said to have all kinds of characteristics.

猶如於幻化，　　
無住無處所，　
了知彼性空，　　
是名意三昧。

They are just like illusions,
Without abode, nowhere to be;
To know that they are empty by nature
Is called the Thought *Samādhi*.

「復次文殊師利！云何名為女相三昧？即說頌曰：

“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! What is the Characteristic of Woman *Samādhi*?” Then he spoke in verse saying:

四大假為女，　　
其中無所有，　
凡夫迷惑心，　　
執取以為實。

The Four Great Elements pose as a woman,
Within, there’s nothing there.
Ordinary men, their minds confused,
Grasp as if she is real.

女人如幻化，　　
愚者不能了，　
妄見女相故，　　
生於染著心。

Women are like illusions,
Fools cannot understand,
From the erroneous view of female characteristics
Their minds become attached.

譬如幻化女，　　
而非實女人，　
無智者迷惑，　　
便生於欲想。

Like an illusory woman,
Which is not a real woman,
The unwise are confused,
And give rise to desirous thoughts.

如是了知已，　　
一切女無相，　
此相皆寂靜，　　
是名女三昧。

When one knows like this,
The charactersticlessness of each woman,
This characteristic being completely quiescent
Is called the Woman *Samādhi*."

「復次文殊師利！云何名為男相三昧？即說頌曰：

“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! What is the Characteristic of Man *Samādhi*?” Then he spoke in verse saying:

自謂是男子，　　
見彼為女人，　
由斯分別心，　　
而生於欲想。

Men consider themselves to be men,
Then see the other as woman.
Due to their differentiating mind
They give rise to desirous thoughts.

欲心本無有，　　
心相不可得，　
由妄分別故，　　
於身起男想。

The desirous mind is originally nonexistent,
The characteristics of mind being unattainable,
Yet due to the error of differentiation,
They give rise to thoughts of ‘manhood’ about the body.

是中實無男，　　
我說如陽焰，　
知男相寂靜，　　
是名男三昧。

Within this, truly there is no man,
I say it is like a mirage,
Knowing male characteristics to be quiescent
Is called the Man *Samādhi*.

「復次文殊師利！云何名為童男相三昧？即說頌曰：

“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! What is the Characteristic of Boy *Samādhi*?” Then he spoke in verse saying:

如樹無根枝，　　
花則不可得，　
以花無有故，　　
其果亦不生。

Like a tree without branches,
Flowers cannot be found,
And because there are no flowers,
The fruit, too, does not arise.

由無彼女人，　　
童男亦非有，　
隨於分別者，　　
假說如是名。

Since there aren’t women,
Boys also are not,
They go along with differentiations,
Like the names of conventional speech.

了知彼女人，　　
及童男非有，　
能如是觀察，　　
是童男三昧。

To know that those women,
As well as boys are not,
Able to observe clearly like this
Is the Boy *Samādhi*

「復次文殊師利！云何名為童女相三昧？即說頌曰：

“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! What is the Characteristic of Girl *Samādhi*?” Then he spoke in verse saying:

如斷多羅樹，　　
畢竟不復生，　
何有智慧人，　　
於中求果實？

Like a severed *tāla* tree,
That will not produce further growth,
How could a wise person
Search for fruit within it? 　

若有能了知，　　
諸法無生者，　
不應起分別，　　
童女為能生。

If one is able to know
The birthlessness of all dharmas,
They should not give rise to the differentiation
That girls can be born.

又如焦穀種，　　
其牙本不生，　
女人亦復然，　　
是童女三昧。

Also, like a charred seed,
Never giving rise to a tap root,
Females also being like this
Is the Girl *Samādhi*.

「復次文殊師利！云何名為天相三昧？即說頌曰：

“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! What is the Characteristic of Deva *Samādhi*?” Then he spoke in verse saying:

因清淨信心，　　
及以眾善業，　
受諸天勝報，　　
端正殊妙身。

Due to a pure, faithful mind,
And an abundance of good *karma*
One receives the superb reward of [rebirth in] heaven
And a proper body of special beauty.

珍寶諸宮殿，　　
非由造作成，　
曼陀羅妙花，　　
亦無種植者。

Precious jewels and palaces
Appear without work or effort.
Marvelous *mandāravas* flower,
While no one plants them.

如是不思議，　　
皆因業力起，　
能現種種相，　　
猶若淨琉璃。

Inconceivable, like this,
Are the arisings from the power of *karma*,
Able to manifest all kinds of characteristics
Like a piece of clear lapis lazuli.

如是殊妙身，　　
及諸宮殿等，　
皆從虛妄生，　　
是名天三昧。

The especially beautiful bodies,
And palaces and other things
All arise from erroneousness,
This is called the Deva *Samādhi*

「復次文殊師利！云何名為龍相三昧？即說頌曰：

“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! What is the Characteristic of Nāga *Samādhi*?” Then he spoke in verse saying:

受此諸龍身，　　
由不修於忍，　
興澍大雲雨，　　
遍滿閻浮提。

They are reborn in nāga bodies,
Those who do not cultivate patience,
Generating great clouds of rain
They inundate Jambudvīpa.

不從前後際，　　
亦不在中間，　
而能生此水，　　
復歸於大海。

Neither from before or after,
And not from somewhere within,
Yet able to generate water,
Which then, to the ocean, returns. 　

如是諸龍等，　　
積習性差別，　
起於種種業，　　
業亦無有生。

Just like the nāgas,
Habits of differentiation accumulate,
Giving rise to all kinds of karma,
Yet karma, too, has no arising.

一切非真實，　　
愚者謂為有，　
能如是了知，　　
是名龍三昧。

Everything unreal,
The ignorant say exists;
To be able to know like this
Is called the Nāga *Samādhi*

「復次文殊師利！云何名為夜叉相三昧？即說頌曰：

“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! What is the Characteristic of Yakṣa *Samādhi*?” Then he spoke in verse saying:

是大夜叉身，　　
從於自心起，　
是中無有實，　　
妄生於恐怖，　
亦無有怖心，　　
而生於怖畏。

A great yakṣa body,
Arises from the mind itself,
Within which there is nothing real,
From error arises fear,
And though there is no fearful mind,
There is the arising from fear.

觀法非實故，　　
無相無所得，　
空無寂靜處，　　
現此夜叉相，　
如是知虛妄，　　
是夜叉三昧。

By observing that because dharmas are not real,
There are no characteristics, nothing to apprehend,
Empty, without quiescent abode,
The manifestation of this characteristic of yakṣa,
Understanding error like this
Is the Yakṣa *Samādhi*.

「復次文殊師利！云何名為乾闥婆相三昧？即說頌曰：

“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! What is the Characteristic of Gandharva *Samādhi*?” Then he spoke in verse saying:

彼實無所趣，　　
名言假施設，　
了知趣非趣，　　
乾闥婆三昧。

There really is no [karmic] destiny
Names are just conventional designations (*prajñapti*);
To know the destiny which is not destined
[Is the] Gandharva *Samādhi*

「復次文殊師利！云何名為阿修羅相三昧？即說頌曰：

“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! What is the Characteristic of Asura *Samādhi*?” Then he spoke in verse saying:

修羅相所印，　　
其相本無生，　
無生故無滅，　　
阿修羅三昧。

The seal (*mūdra*) of Asura-ness (the syllable ‘A’),
Its characteristic is originally without arising,
Since unarisen, without cessation,
[This is the] Asura *Samādhi.*

「復次文殊師利！云何名為迦樓羅相三昧？即說頌曰：

“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! What is the Characteristic of Garuḍa *Samādhi*?” Then he spoke in verse saying:

無身以為身，　　
名字假施設，　
名相無所有，　　
迦樓羅三昧。

Bodilessness for a body,
Called by conventional designations
The characteristics of names being without existence,
[This is the] Garuḍa *Samādhi*

「復次文殊師利！云何名為緊那羅相三昧？即說頌曰：

“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! What is the Characteristic of Kinnara *Samādhi*?” Then he spoke in verse saying:

法無作而作，　　
說為緊那羅，　
了知此不生，　　
緊那羅三昧。

Dharmas are uncreated, hence they are created
What is said to be a Kinnara,
Knowing this to be unarisen,
[Is the] Kinnara *Samādhi*.

「復次文殊師利！云何名為摩睺羅伽相三昧？即說頌曰：

“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! What is the Characteristic of Mahoraga *Samādhi*?” Then he spoke in verse saying:

彼由於名字，　　
隨世而安立，　
是中無有法，　　
而妄起分別。

There is that because of a name,
According to the world it is therefore established,
Wherein there is nothing (no *dharma*),
Yet from error there arises differentiation.

了知此分別，　　
自性無所有，　
彼相寂靜故，　　
摩睺羅三昧。

To know that this differentiation
Has no inherent nature,
Because the characteristic of ‘that’ is quiescent
[There is] the Mahoraga *Samādhi*

「復次文殊師利！云何名為地獄相三昧？即說頌曰：

“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! What is the Characteristic of Naraka *Samādhi* (’Hell Dweller’)?” Then he spoke in verse saying:

地獄空無相，　　
其性極清淨，　
是中無作者，　　
從自分別生。

Hell dwellers are empty, without characteristics,
Their nature is extremely pure,
Therein, there is no creator,
They arise [only] from differentiations of self.

我坐道場時，　　
了此無生相，　
無相無生故，　　
其性如虛空，　
此相皆寂靜，　　
是地獄三昧。

When I sat upon the site of enlightenment,
And realized this characteristic of non-arising,
Due to characteristiclessness and unarisenness,
Their natures being like empty space,
This characteristic that is completely quiescent
Is the Hell Dweller *Samādhi*.

「復次文殊師利！云何名為畜生相三昧？即說頌曰：

“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! What is the Characteristic of Animal *Samādhi*?” Then he spoke in verse saying:

如雲現眾色，　　
是中無有實，　
能令無智人，　　
於此生迷惑，

Like clouds appearing to be various colors,
Really they are without color
But they are able to cause an unwise person
To become confused about this,

於彼畜生趣，　　
而受種種身。
猶如虛空雲，　　
現於諸色像，

And about those born as animals,
Receiving all kinds of different bodies,
Just like clouds in the sky,
They appear in all shapes and sizes,

了知業如幻，　　
不生迷惑心，　
彼相本寂靜，　　
是畜生三昧。

Understanding karma to be like an illusion
Not giving rise to a confused mind,
The characteristic of ‘that’ being originally quiescent,
Is the Animal *Samādhi*.

「復次文殊師利！云何名為閻魔羅界三昧？即說頌曰：

“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! What is the Characteristic of Yama World *Samādhi*?” Then he spoke in verse saying:

造作純黑業，　　
及以雜業者，　
流轉閻羅界，　　
受於種種苦。

By creating pure and impure karma,
The one who ‘mixes’ the karma
Transmigrates through the Yama World,
Receiving all kinds of suffering. 　

實無閻羅界，　　
亦無流轉者，　
自性本無生，　　
諸苦猶如夢，　
若能如是觀，　　
閻羅界三昧。

In reality there is no Yama World
And no one who transmigrates.
Inherent nature is originally without arising,
All suffering is just like in dreams,
If one can observe like this
Yama World *Samādhi*.

「復次文殊師利！云何名為貪相三昧？即說頌曰：

“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! What is the Characteristic of Desire (*rāga*) *Samādhi*?” Then he spoke in verse saying:

貪從分別生，　　
分別亦非有，　
無生亦無相，　　
住處不可得。

Desire arises from differentiation (*vikalpa*),
Differentiation, too, is non-existent;
Without arising and without characteristics,
Its location cannot be found.

貪性如虛空，　　
亦無有建立，　
凡夫妄分別，　　
由斯貪染生。

The nature of desire is like empty space,
It too is without foundation;
A common person erroneously differentiates,
And hence the defilement of desire arises.

法性本無染，　　
清淨如虛空，　
十方遍推求，　　
其性不可得。

The nature of *dharmas* is originally without defilement,
It is pure, like empty space;
Though one may search throughout the Ten Directions,
Their nature cannot be found.

不了性空故，　　
見貪生怖畏，　
無畏生畏想，　　
於何得安樂？

Not understanding the emptiness of nature,
Seeing desire gives rise to terror.
Fearful thoughts arising, when there is nothing to fear.
How could they ever attain happiness?

譬如愚癡人，　　
怖畏於虛空，　
驚懼而馳走，　　
避空不欲見。

Just like foolish people
Who are terrified of empty space,
Startled and afraid, they gallop away,
Not wanting to see space, which is unavoidable.

虛空遍一切，　　
於何而得離？　
愚夫迷惑故，　　
顛倒分別生。

Empty space is everywhere,
Where is there to escape?
Due to the errors of confusion
Inverted differentiation arises.

貪本無自性，　　
妄生厭離心，　
如人欲避空，　　
終無能脫者；

Desire originally lacks inherent self-nature,
Yet there are those who erroneously try to renounce it;
Like someone wanting to avoid space,
Forever unable to be free;

諸法性自離，　　
猶如於涅槃。　
三世一切佛，　　
了知貪性空，

The nature of *dharmas* is automatically free
Just like being in *nirvāṇa*;
All buddhas of the three periods,
Know the emptiness of the nature of desire.

住此境界中，　　
未曾有捨離；　
於貪怖畏者，　　
思惟求解脫。

To abide within this realm (*viṣaya*)
Is unprecedented relinquishment (*upekṣā*);
Those who fear desire,
Ponder in search of liberation.

如是貪自性，　　
究竟常清淨，　
我證菩提時，　　
了達皆平等。

The inherent nature of desire is like this,
Ultimately always pure;
When I realized *bodhi*,
It was total comprehension of equanimity.

若執貪為有，　　
於彼當捨離，　
由妄分別故，　　
而言捨離貪。

If one holds that desire exists,
And that it should be abandoned,
It is due to erroneous differentiation
That one says desire is to be renounced.

此唯分別心，　　
實無有捨離，　
其性不可得，　　
亦無有滅壞，

There is only the differentiating mind,
In truth, there is no relinquishment;
Its nature cannot be found,
So it cannot be extinguished.　

平等實際中，　　
無解脫分別。　
若於貪解脫，　　
於空亦解脫，

Within the limit of the truth of equanimity,
There is neither liberation nor differentiation.
If one could be liberated from desire,
One could also be liberated from space.

虛空及與貪，　　
無盡無差別；　
若見差別者，　　
我說令捨離。

Empty space as well as desire,
They are without exhaustion, without differentiation:
One who sees differentiation,
I say they should relinquish that.

貪實無有生，　　
妄起生分別，　
彼貪本性空，　　
但有假名字，

In truth, desire never arises;
It is only differentiation that arises from error,
The nature of that desire is originally empty,
It is just a conventional name.

不應以此名，　　
而生於執著。　
了貪無染故，　　
是則畢竟空，

One should not, from a name,
Give rise to such attachment;
To realize that desire is without defilement
Is to realize ultimate emptiness.

不由滅壞貪，　　
而得於解脫。　
貪法與佛法，　　
平等即涅槃，

It is not through the destruction of desire
That one attains liberation.
The things (*dharma*) of desire and the Buddha-Dharma
Are equal in *nirvāṇa*.

智者應當知，　　
了貪寂靜已，　
入於寂靜界，　　
是名貪三昧。

The wise should know,
To understand the quiescence of desire,
Entering the ultimate realm,
This is called the Desire *Samādhi*.

「復次文殊師利！云何名為瞋相三昧？即說頌曰：

“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! What is the Characteristic of Anger (*dveṣa*) *Samādhi*?” Then he spoke in verse saying:

以虛妄因緣，　　
而起於瞋恚，　
無我執為我，　　
及由麁惡聲，

By the dependent conditions of error
Hatred then comes to be,
One clings to the 'I' when there is no I,
And, from the ‘dust’ of bad sounds,

起猛利瞋心，　　
猶如於惡毒，　
音聲及瞋恚，　　
究竟無所有。

Intense hatred arises,
Which is like a vicious poison.
Sound and hatred
Ultimately cannot be found.

如鑽木出火，　　
要假眾緣力，　
若緣不和合，　　
火終不得生。

Like boring wood to start a fire,
Many conditions must be fulfilled,
If the conditions are not met,
Fire cannot possibly come forth.

是不悅意聲，　　
畢竟無所有，　
知聲性空故，　　
瞋亦不復生。

Likewise, speech unpleasant to hear
Ultimately cannot be found.
If one knows the nature of sound is empty,
Anger, too, will no longer arise.

瞋不在於聲，　　
亦不身中住，　
因緣和合起，　　
離緣終不生。

Anger is not in sound,
and neither does it abide in the body;
It is a product of causes and conditions,
Beyond the condition of ever arising.

如因乳等緣，　　
和合生酥酪，　
瞋自性無起，　　
因於麁惡聲。

Just as butter comes to be
From a combination of milk and other agents,
Anger, in itself, does not arise,
Except for the dust of bad sounds.

愚者不能了，　　
熱惱自燒然，　
應當如是知，　　
究竟無所有。

Fools cannot understand,
So they burn themselves with the heat of anger.
You should know like this,
Ultimately, nothing can be found

瞋性本寂靜，　　
但有於假名，　
瞋恚即實際，　　
以依真如起，　
了知如法界，　　
是名瞋三昧。

The nature of anger is originally quiescent;
It is just a conventional name;
Hatred is reality itself,
Arising in dependence upon Suchness;
Knowing hatred to be the Dharmadhatu
Is called the Hatred *Samādhi*."

「復次文殊師利！云何名為癡相三昧？即說頌曰：

“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! What is the Characteristic of Delusion (*moha*) *Samādhi*?” Then he spoke in verse saying:

無明體性空，　　
本自無生起，　
是中無少法，　　
而可說為癡。

The essential nature of ignorance is empty,
Originally, itself, not arisen;
Herein there is not the least thing (*dharma*)
That can be called delusion. 　

凡夫於無癡，　　
而妄生癡想，　
於無著生著，　　
猶若結虛空。

Ordinary people take what is not delusional
And there arises delusional thoughts;
They are attached, while there is nothing to be attached to,
Like trying to tie empty space into a knot.

奇哉愚癡人，　　
不應作而作，　
諸法皆非有，　　
雜染分別生。

Strange indeed are these fools,
They do what they should not do.
There are no *dharmas*,
Yet differentiation engenders a myriad defilements.　

如欲取虛空，　　
安置於一處，　
設經千萬劫，　　
終無有積聚。

If one wants to grab space,
And put it in a certain place,
Even in millions of *kalpas*
They will never complete the task.

愚夫從本來，　　
經不思議劫，　
所起於癡結，　　
而無少分增。

Fools, since the beginning,
For inconceivable numbers of *kalpas*,
Have given rise to 'knots of delusion’,
Yet, there isn’t the slightest increase.

如彼取虛空，　　
終無有增減，　
多劫集於癡，　　
增減亦如是。

Just like that person trying to grab empty space,
Forever without increase or decrease,
Delusion, amassed over many *kalpas*,
Increases and decreases just like this.

又如於槖籥，　　
受風無際限，　
愚癡著欲樂，　　
無有厭足時。

Also like a bellows,
Taking in endless amounts of air,
Fools grasp at sensuous pleasures,
Without ever being satisfied.

是癡無所有，　　
無根無住處，　
以根非有故，　　
亦無癡可盡。

This delusion has no existence,
No root, and no abode,
Since it has no root,
There is no delusion that could be ended.

以癡無盡故，　　
邊際不可得，　
是故諸眾生，　　
我不能令盡。

Since delusion has no end,
Its bounds cannot be found,
For this reason, all sentient beings,
I can never finish liberating.

設我一日中，　　
能度三千界，　
所有諸眾生，　　
皆令入涅槃，

Even if, in a single day,
I was able to deliver all the beings
In a billion-world universe,
Causing them to realize Nirvāṇa;

復經不思議，　　
無量千萬劫，　
日日如是化，　　
眾生界不盡。

And for inconceivable
Immeasurable thousands and millions of *kalpas*,
Day after day, there was liberation such as this,
The realm of sentient beings would still not be exhausted.

癡界眾生界，　　
是二俱無相，　
彼皆如幻化，　　
故不能令盡。

The realm of delusion and the realm of sentient beings,
They are both entirely without characteristics,
They are totally like illusions,
Therefore they are unable to be ceased. 　

癡性與佛性，　　
平等無差別，　
若分別於佛，　　
彼則住愚癡。

The nature of delusion along with the nature of buddhas
Are equal, without difference,
If one differentiates a buddha,
Then they abide in delusion.

癡及一切智，　　
性皆不可得，　
然彼諸眾生，　　
皆與癡平等。

From delusion to omniscience,
Their natures cannot be found,
It is just that sentient beings
And delusion are equal.

眾生不思議，　　
癡亦不思議，　
以不思議故，　　
不應取分別。

Sentient beings are inconceivable,
Delusion, too, is inconceivable,
And because they are both inconceivable,
A distinction should not be made between them.

如是思惟心，　　
思量不可得，　
癡亦不可量，　　
以無邊際故。

Like this, the thinking mind,
Its measurement cannot be found,
Delusion, too, is immeasurable,
Because it is boundless.

既無有邊際，　　
從何而得生，　
自性無生故，　　
相亦不可得。

Since it has no bounds,
From where could it arise?
Because inherent self-nature does not arise
Characteristics, too, cannot be found.

了癡無有相，　　
觀佛亦復然，　
應當如是知，　　
一切法無二。

Understanding delusion to be without characteristics,
Observe the Buddha also in this way,
One should know like this,
All dharmas are non-dual.　

癡性本寂靜，　　
但有於假名，　
我證菩提時，　　
亦了癡平等，　
能作如是觀，　　
是名癡三昧。

The nature of delusion is originally quiescent,
It is merely a conventional term,
When I realized bodhi,
I understood it to be the same as delusion.
Being able to observe like this
Is called the Delusion *Samādhi*.

「復次文殊師利！云何名為不善三昧？即說頌曰：

“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! What is the [Characteristic of] Unwholesome Dharma *Samādhi*?” Then he spoke in verse saying:

知彼貪瞋癡，　　
種種諸煩惱，　
所有諸行相，　　
虛妄無真實，　
能如是觀察，　　
是不善三昧。

Knowing that greed, anger, and delusion,
Their various kinds of afflictions,
And all the characteristics of their conditioning
Are erroneous and not true,
To be able to observe like this
Is the Unwholesome *Samādhi*.

「復次文殊師利！云何名為善法三昧？即說頌曰：

“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! What is the [Characteristic of] Wholesome Dharma *Samādhi*?” Then he spoke in verse saying:

汝等應當知，　　
諸善意樂者，　
心行各差別，　　
皆同於一行。

You all should know,
Those with wholesome thoughts
Although each has different mental conditioning (*saṃskāra*),
In all, they are a single conditioned action.

以一出離相，　　
了知於一切，　
皆悉寂靜故，　　
是名善三昧。

Transcending characteristics through unity,
And understanding everything
Because everything is completely quiescent.
Is called the Wholesome *Samādhi*.

「復次文殊師利！云何名有為三昧？即說頌曰：

“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! What is the Characteristic of the Conditioned *Samādhi*?” Then he spoke in verse saying:

汝等應當知，　　
一切有為法，　
非是所造作，　　
亦無可稱量。

You all should know,
All conditioned dharmas,
Have no creator,
And also cannot be measured.

我了知諸行，　　
性無有積集，　
一切皆寂靜，　　
名有為三昧。

My understanding of all conditioned actions (*saṃskāra*),
The nature of which does not aggregate,
Everything being completely quiescent,
Is called the Conditioned *Samādhi*.

「復次文殊師利！云何名無為三昧？即說頌曰：

“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! What is the Characteristic of the Unconditioned *Samādhi*?” Then he spoke in verse saying:

無為性寂靜，　　
於中無所著，　
亦復無出離，　　
但有假名字。

The nature of the unconditioned is quiescent,
Therein there is no grasping,
There is also no escaping,
These are only conventional designations. 　

為執著眾生，　　
而說彼名字，　
能如是了知，　　
名無為三昧。」

For clinging sentient beings,
I therefore speak in conventional terms,
To be able to know, like this,
Is called the Unconditioned *Samādhi*

爾時世尊說如是等不可思議微妙偈時，九萬二千菩薩得無生法忍，三萬六千比丘而於諸漏心得解脫；七十二萬億那由他諸天及六千比丘尼、一百八十萬優婆塞、二千二百優婆夷等，皆發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心。

At that time, when the World-Honored One had spoken these inconceivably subtle verses, ninety-two thousand bodhisattvas attained the patient tolerance of the birthlessness of dharmas and thirty-six thousand *bhikṣus* attained liberation from all mental outflows; ninety-two million *nayutas* of devas along with six thousand *bhikṣuṇīs*, one hundred and eighty thousand *upāsakas*, and two thousand two hundred *upāsikās* all generated *anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi citta*.

爾時文殊師利菩薩復白佛言：「唯願世尊！為諸菩薩演說種種三昧名字，令其聞者諸根通利，而於諸法得智慧明，不為一切邪見眾生之所摧伏，亦令證得四無礙辯，於一文字而能了知種種文字，於諸文字了一文字。復以無邊辯才，為諸眾生善說法要，亦令證得甚深法忍，於一剎那了一切行。是一切行，各各復有無邊行相皆能了知。」

Then Mañjuśrī again addressed the Buddha saying, “Please, World-Honored One! Broadly expound the names of s*amādhis* for the bodhisattvas, so that those who hear them are benefited, and they attain the light of the wisdom of all dharmas, not to be controlled by those with false views, that they may realize and achieve the four kinds of unhindered eloquence and by a single word they are able to understand all kinds of languages, and by all languages they are able to understand a single word. And also, that they may teach the essence of the Dharma to sentient beings, and do so
skillfully and with boundless eloquence, and they cause them to realize the patient tolerance of the birthlessness of all dharmas, understanding in an instant all actions, as well as the infinite forms
and varieties of each of them.”

佛言：「文殊師利！有三昧名無邊離垢，若菩薩得此三昧，能現一切諸清淨色。復有三昧名可畏面，得此三昧有大威光映蔽日月。復有三昧名出焰光，得此三昧能蔽一切釋梵威光。復有三昧名為出離，得此三昧令諸眾生出離一切貪恚愚癡。復有三昧名無礙光，得此三昧則能照曜一切佛剎。復有三昧名無忘失，得此三昧能持諸佛所說教法，亦能為他敷演斯義。復有三昧名曰雷音，得此三昧善能顯示一切言音上至梵世。復有三昧名為喜樂，得此三昧令諸眾生喜樂滿足。復有三昧名喜無厭，得此三昧其見聞者無有厭足。復有三昧名專一境難思功德，得此三昧而能示現一切神變。復有三昧名解一切眾生語言，得此三昧善能宣說一切語言，於一字中說一切字，了一切字同於一字。復有三昧名超一切陀羅尼王，得此三昧能善了知諸陀羅尼。復有三昧名為一切辯才莊嚴，得此三昧善能分別一切文字種種言音。復有三昧名為積集一切善法，得此三昧能令眾生悉聞佛聲法聲僧聲、聲聞聲緣覺聲、菩薩聲波羅蜜聲，如是菩薩住三昧時，令諸眾生聞聲不絕。」

The Buddha said, “Mañjuśrī! There is a s*amādhi* called Infinite Stainlessness. If bodhisattvas attain this s*amādhi* they can manifest the purity of all forms. There is also a s*amādhi* called Face of Courage. One who attains this s*amādhi* has an awesome light outshining the sun and moon. There is also a s*amādhi* called Emitting Flaming Light. One who attains this s*amādhi* outshines Śakra and Brahma. There is also a s*amādhi* called Toward Transcendence. One who attains this s*amādhi c*an
cause sentient beings to transcend desire, hatred, and delusion. There is also a s*amādhi* called Unobstructed Light.  One who attains this s*amādhi* can illuminate all buddha lands. There is also a s*amādhi* called Unforgetting. One who attains this s*amādhi* can hold in mind the Dharma tuaght by all Buddhas and expound it to others. There is also a s*amādhi* known as Thundering Voice. One who attains this s*amādhi* can speak well in all languages and tones, including those of the Brahma World. There is also a s*amādhi* called Toward Joy. One who attains this s*amādhi* can cause all sentient beings to be filled with joy. There is also a s*amādhi* called Insatiable Delight. One who attains this s*amādhi,* people will not be tired of seeing or hearing them. There is also a s*amādhi* called Inconceivable Merit of Focus on a Single Object. One who attains this s*amādhi* can manifest all spiritual transformations (*vikurvaṇa*). There is also a s*amādhi* called Understanding the Languages of All Sentient Beings. One who attains this s*amādhi* can speak all languages with proficiency, can express all words in one word, and can understand that all words are one word. There is also a s*amādhi* called Surpassing All Dhāraṇī King. One who attains this s*amādhi* can thoroughly understand all *dhāraṇīs*. There is also a s*amādhi* called Toward the Adornment of Complete Eloquence. One who attains this s*amādhi* will be well versed in all written and spoken languages. There is also a s*amādhi* called Toward the Accumulation of all Wholesome Dharmas. One who attains this s*amādhi* can cause sentient beings to hear the sound of the Buddha, the sound of the Dharma, and the sound of the Sangha; the sound of *śrāvaka*s, the sound of pratyekabuddhas, the sound of Bodhisattvas, and the sounds of the *pāramitās*; When bodhisattvas abide in s*amādhi* like this, they cause sentient beings to hear these teachings continuously."

爾時文殊師利白佛言：「唯願世尊！加威護念，令我獲得無礙辯才，說此法門殊勝功德。」

At that time, Mañjuśrī addressed the Buddha saying, “Please, World-Honored One! Guard me in mind and help me attain unhindered eloquence and explain the extraordinary merit of this Dharma Door.”

佛言：「善哉！隨汝所願。」

The Buddha said, “Excellent! As you wish.”

文殊師利復白佛言：「若有菩薩於此法門受持讀誦無疑惑者，當知是人於現身中，決定獲得四種辯才，所謂捷疾辯才、廣大辯才、甚深辯才、無盡辯才，於諸眾生心常護念，隨所修行欲毀壞者，皆能覺悟令無毀壞。」

Mañjuśrī again addressed the Buddha saying, “If there are bodhisattvas who accept, practice, read, and recite this Dharma Door without doubt, you should know, they will definitely acquire in this present life four kinds of eloquence; namely, ready eloquence, great eloquence, profound eloquence, and inexhaustible eloquence. They will always remember to protect sentient beings, and, by thwarting those who intend to destroy their practice, they will be able to attain enlightenment.”

爾時世尊讚文殊師利菩薩言：「善哉善哉！汝於斯義能善分別，如布施者獲大財富，持禁戒者決定生天。若能受持此經典者，現得辯才必無虛妄。如日光出能除諸暝，亦如菩薩坐菩提座成等正覺決定無疑，受持讀誦是經典者，現得辯才亦復如是。文殊師利！若復有人於現身中欲求辯才，當於此經心生信樂，受持讀誦廣為人說，勿生疑惑。」

At that time the World-Honored One praised Mañjuśrī bodhisattva saying, “Excellent, excellent! You are able to understand the meaning of this very well. Just as those who give will surely gain immense wealth, and as those who keep precepts will be reborn in heaven, so those who accept and practice this sutra will unquestionably achieve eloquence in this life. Just as sunlight can surely dispel all darkness, and just as bodhisattvas will surely attain supreme enlightenment when they sit on the seat of *bodhi*, so those who accept, practice, read, and recite this sutra will achieve eloquence in this life without fail. Mañjuśrī! If someone is able to seek eloquence in this life, they should believe in, rejoice at, accept, practice, read, and recite this sutra and explain it to others without entertaining any doubts."

爾時無垢藏菩薩白佛言：「世尊！若諸菩薩，佛涅槃後於此法門心無疑惑，受持讀誦為他廣說，我當攝受加其辯才。」

Then Amalagarbha Bodhisattva addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! After the *nirvāṇa* of the Buddha, if bodhisattvas, free of doubt, accept, practice, read, and recite this Dharma Door and explain it to others, I will hold them in my embrace and enhance their eloquence."

爾時天魔波旬愁憂苦惱悲涕流淚來詣佛所，而白佛言：「如來昔證無上菩提，我於爾時已懷憂惱。復於今者說此法門，倍生大苦如中毒箭。若諸眾生聞是經典，決定當於阿耨多羅三藐三菩提無有退轉入般涅槃，令我境界皆悉空虛。如來、應、正等覺能令一切諸苦眾生咸得安樂，願垂哀愍與大慈悲，不於此經加威護念，令我安隱憂苦皆除。」

At that time, the celestial Māra Pāpīyān was stricken with worry and grief. With tears in his eyes, he came to the Buddha and addressed the Buddha saying, "When the Tathāgata was attaining supreme enlightenment in the past, I writhed in worry and agony. Now your preaching of this Dharma Door redoubles my pain, and I feel as if I have been shot by a poisonous arrow. If sentient beings hear this sutra they will definitely not regress from their pursuit of *anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi*, and will eventually enter *parinirvāṇa*. This will reduce my domain to nothing. The Tathāgata, the Worthy One, the Supremely Enlightened One, can give peace and happiness to all living beings in distress. May the Tathāgata be so kind and compassionate as to not bless this sutra, and thus give me peace and security and eliminate all my worry and pain."

爾時世尊告波旬言：「勿懷憂惱。我於此法不作加護，諸眾生等亦不涅槃。」天魔波旬聞是語已，歡喜踊躍憂惱悉除，即於佛前忽然不現。

Then the World-Honored One told Pāpīyān saying, “Do not worry. I shall not bless this
sutra, nor will sentient beings enter *parinirvāṇa*." Hearing this, the celestial Māra Pāpīyān danced with joy; all his worries and sorrow vanished. He suddenly disappeared from the presence of the Buddha.”

爾時文殊師利菩薩前白佛言：「如來今者有何密意，告波旬言我於此法不作加護？」

Then Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva, before the Buddha, addressed him saying, “What was the Tathāgata’s secret intention just now in telling Pāpīyān , 'I shall not bless this Dharma'?"

佛言：「文殊師利！以無加護加護此法，是故為彼說如是言。以一切法平等實際，皆歸真如同於法界，離諸言說不二相故，無有加護。以我如是誠實之言無有虛妄，能令此經於閻浮提廣行流布。」

The Buddha said, “Mañjuśrī! I bless this Dharma by not blessing it; thus, I told him that. Because all dharmas are equal in reality, return to suchness, are identical with the Dharmadhatu, defy speech, and transcend duality, there is no blessing. Because I speak the truth and not falsehood, this sutra will prevail widely in the world."

爾時世尊說是語已，告阿難言：「此經名為『普入不思議法門』，若能受持如是經典，則為受持八萬四千法門等無差別。何以故？我於此經善通達已，方能為彼諸眾生等演說八萬四千法門。是故阿難！汝於此法當善護持，讀誦流通無令忘失。」

After the World-Honored One had said this, he told Ānanda, "This sutra is named the *Universal Dharma Door to the Inconceivable*. Accepting and practicing this sutra is not different from accepting and practicing the eighty-four thousand Dharma Doors. Why? Because it was only after I became conversant with it that I was able to expound the eighty-four thousand Dharma Doors to all living beings. Therefore, Ānanda, you should carefully protect and uphold this sutra and read,
recite, and circulate it so that it may not be forgotten or lost."

佛說是經已，文殊師利菩薩、無垢藏菩薩、尊者阿難，及諸世間天、人、阿修羅、乾闥婆等，聞佛所說，皆大歡喜，信受奉行。

When the Buddha had spoken this sutra, Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī, Bodhisattva Amalagarbha, Venerable Ānanda, humans, devas, asuras, gandharvas, and others were all jubilant over the Buddha's teaching. They accepted it with faith and began to practice it with veneration.

VAJRA PRAJÑĀPĀRAMITĀ SŪTRA

For the benefit of all sentient beings
為了所有眾生的利

## CHAPTER ONE

如是我聞:

Thus have I heard:

一時，佛在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園，與大 比丘眾千二百五十人俱.爾時，世尊食 時，著衣持鉢，入舍衛大城乞食.於其 城中，次第乞已，還至本處.飯食訖, 收衣鉢，洗足已，敷座而坐.

Once, [the Buddha](https://www.notion.so/Gautama-Buddha-7a9e6fae65ac42f2ba609666e78c42b3?pvs=21) was in the kingdom of [Śravasti](https://www.notion.so/ravasti-e3bbe197a061402395f888b2465ef4e4?pvs=21), in the Jetavana, Anāthapindika’s Park, along with a great assembly of [bhikṣus](https://www.notion.so/bhik-us-b328533226be4738ac812c8d956fc745?pvs=21), one thousand two hundred fifty people in all. At that time, the World-Honored One prepared to eat, put on his robe, took up his bowl, and entered the great city of [Śravasti](https://www.notion.so/ravasti-e3bbe197a061402395f888b2465ef4e4?pvs=21) to beg for food. Inside the city he went begging door to door, then returned to where he was staying. When he finished eating his meal he put away his robe and bowl, washed his feet, spread out a seat, and then sat.

## CHAPTER TWO

時，長老須菩提在大眾中即從座起, 偏袒右肩，右膝著地，合掌恭敬而白佛 言，“希有!世尊!如來善護念諸菩薩, 善付囑諸菩薩.世尊!善男子，善女 人，發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，應云何 住?云何降伏其心?”

佛言:“善哉，善哉!須菩提!如汝所說: ‘如來善護念諸菩薩，善付囑諸菩薩.’ 汝今諦聽，當為汝說.善男子，善女人, 發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，應如是住, 如是降伏其心.”

“唯然.世尊!願樂欲聞.”

Then, among the great assembly, Venerable Subhūti arose from his seat, bared his right shoulder, placed his right knee on the ground, joined his palms and reverentially addressed the [Buddha](https://www.notion.so/Gautama-Buddha-7a9e6fae65ac42f2ba609666e78c42b3?pvs=21) saying, “Most rare! World-Honored One! The Thus Come One virtuously keeps in mind all bodhisattvas, virtuously entrusting all bodhisattvas. World-Honored One! When virtuous men and women develop the mind of [anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi](https://www.notion.so/anuttar-samyak-sa-bodhi-9b672affd2374233aa1fe098d6d6af87?pvs=21), how should they abide? How can they master their mind?”

The Buddha replied, “Excellent, excellent! Subhūti! As you have said, ‘The Thus Come One virtuously keeps in mind all [bodhisattvas](https://www.notion.so/bodhisattva-ed969c5cb9b646ddbd24779bf0ae827a?pvs=21), virtuously entrusting all [bodhisattvas](https://www.notion.so/bodhisattva-ed969c5cb9b646ddbd24779bf0ae827a?pvs=21).’ Listen attentively, and I will tell you. Virtuous men and women who develop the mind of [anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi](https://www.notion.so/anuttar-samyak-sa-bodhi-9b672affd2374233aa1fe098d6d6af87?pvs=21) should abide thus. Like this, mastering their mind.

“Please continue, World-Honored One! We joyfully wish to hear.”

## CHAPTER THREE

佛告須菩提: “諸菩薩摩訶薩應如是降伏 其心:‘所有一切眾生之類，若卵生‚ 若胎生，若濕生，若化生，若有色‚ 若無色，若有想，若無想，若非有想非 無想，我皆令入無餘涅槃而滅度之.’ 如是滅度無量無數無邊眾生，實無眾生 得滅度者.何以故?須菩提!若菩薩 有我相，人相，眾生相，壽者相，即非 菩薩."

The Buddha told Subhūti, “All [bodhisattva](https://www.notion.so/bodhisattva-ed969c5cb9b646ddbd24779bf0ae827a?pvs=21), mahāsattvas should master their mind like this: ‘Of all kinds of sentient beings; whether born from an egg or a womb; born from moisture or by metamorphosis; whether with form or without form; whether with perception, without perception, or neither with perception nor non-perception; I cause them all to enter remainderless Nirvana, thereby liberating them.’ Like this, immeasurable, incalculable, illimitable sentient beings are liberated, while, in reality, no sentient being attains liberation. Why? Subhūti! If bodhisattvas possess the characteristics of a self, an individual, a sentient being, or a living thing, then they are not bodhisattvas.”

## CHAPTER FOUR

“復次，須菩提! 菩薩於法，應無所住‚ 行於布施，所謂不住色布施，不住聲‚ 香，味，觸，法布施.須菩提!菩薩應 如是布施，不住於相.何以故?若菩薩不 住相布施，其福德不可思量.”

“須菩提! 於意云何? 東方虛空可思量 不?”

“不也，世尊!”

“須菩提! 南西北方四維上下虛空可思量 不?”

“不也，世尊!”

“須菩提! 菩薩無住相布施，福德亦復 如是不可思量. 須菩提! 菩薩但應如所 教住.”

“Furthermore, Subhuti! Bodhisattvas should not abide in any [dharma](https://www.notion.so/dharma-c62e2c68d2f04139ac57eea6f8bf778e?pvs=21) when practicing giving. This is what is called practicing giving without abiding in forms; giving without abiding in sounds, scents, flavors, feelings or thoughts. Subhuti! Bodhisattvas should give like this, without abiding in [characteristics](https://www.notion.so/lak-a-a-descriptive-marks-b2ca0ac1d93c40e5ba909898f1d079f0?pvs=21). Why? If bodhisattvas give without abiding in characteristics, the rewards are inconceivable.”

“Subhuti! What do you think? The space in the eastern direction can be conceived of, can it not?”

“It cannot, World-Honored One!”

“Subhuti! The space in the northern, western, southern, and four ordinal directions, as well as above and below can be conceived of, can it not?”

“It cannot, World-Honored One!”

“Subhuti! Bodhisattvas giving without abiding in characteristics receive rewards that are also like this, inconceivable. Subhuti! Bodhisattvas should abide only as has been taught.”

## CHAPTER FIVE

“須菩提! 於意云何? 可以身相見如來 不?”

“不也，世尊! 不可以身相得見如來. 何以故?如來所說身相，即非身相.”

佛告須菩提: “凡所有相，皆是虛妄. 若見諸相非相，則見如來.”

“Subhuti! What do you think? Can the Thus Come One be seen by bodily characteristics, or not?”

“No, World-Honored One! The Thus Come One cannot be seen by bodily characteristics. Why? The Thus Come One says bodily characteristics are not bodily characteristics.

The Buddha told Subhuti: “Anything with characteristics is a delusion. If you see all characteristics not as characteristics, then you will see the Thus Come One.”

## CHAPTER SIX

須菩提白佛言: “世尊! 頗有眾生，得聞 如是言說章句，生實信不?”

佛告須菩提:“莫作是說.如來滅後‚ 後五百歲，有持戒修福者，於此章句能 生信心，以此為實，當知是人不於一佛 二佛三四五佛而種善根，已於無量千萬 佛所種諸善根，聞是章句，乃至一念生 淨信者，須菩提!如來悉知悉見是諸眾 生得如是無量福德.何以故?是諸眾生 無復我相，人相，眾生相，壽者相.”

“無法相，亦無非法相.何以故?是諸 眾生若心取相，則為著我，人，眾生‚ 壽者.”

“若取法相，即著我，人，眾生，壽者. 何以故?若取非法相，即著我，人，眾生‚ 壽者‚ 是故不應取法‚ 不應取非法.以是 義故，如來常說:‘汝等比丘，知我說法‚ 如筏喻者，法尚應捨，何況非法.’”

Subhuti addressed the Buddha saying: “World-Honored One! There are many sentient beings who, upon hearing these verses spoken, will produce real confidence, are there not?”

The Buddha told Subhuti, “Do not say this. Five hundred years after the passing of the Thus Come One, there will be those upholding precepts, cultivating rewards. From these statements they will be able to produce a confident mind, and by this reality, you should know, these people have planted virtuous roots under not one buddha, two buddhas, three, four or five buddhas. It is under immeasurable thousands of tens of thousands of buddhas that they have planted all virtuous roots. Hearing these verses, even for an instant, these people will produce pure confidence. Subhuti! The Thus Come One fully knows and fully sees all these sentient beings obtain immeasurable merit like this. Why? Because all these sentient beings are also without the characteristics of selves, individuals, sentient beings, or living things.”

“They are without the characteristics of dharmas, and are also without the characteristics of what are not dharmas. Why? Of all these sentient beings, if their minds grasp at characteristics, then they would become attached to a self, an individual, a sentient being, and a living thing.”

“If they grasp at the characteristics of dharmas, then they would be attached to a self, an individual, a sentient being, and a living thing. Why? If they grasp at the characteristics of what are not dharmas, then they would still be attached to a self, an individual, a sentient being, and a living thing. For this reason, they should not grasp at dharmas, nor should they grasp at what are not dharmas. It is for this reason the Thus Come One always says: ‘All you bhikṣus know, the Dharma I speak is like the parable of the raft. The Dharma should, nevertheless, be abandoned. How much more so what is not the Dharma.’”

## CHAPTER SEVEN

“須菩提!於意云何? 如來得阿耨多羅三 藐三菩提耶?如來有所說法耶?”

“Subhuti, what do you think? Has the Thus Come One attained *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*? Has the Thus Come One spoken the Dharma?”

須菩提言: “如我解佛所說義，無有定法 名阿耨多羅三藐三菩提，亦無有定法‚ 如來可說.何以故?如來所說法，皆不 可取，不可說，非法，非非法.所以者 何? 一切賢聖皆以無為法而有差別.”

Subhuti said: “As I understand the meaning of what the Buddha has said, there is no definite dharma called *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*, and there is no definite dharma the Thus Come One can speak. Why is this? Because the Dharma the Thus Come One speaks cannot be held, cannot be spoken; is neither dharma nor not dharma. Why? All saints and sages are distinguished by unconditioned Dharma.”

## CHAPTER EIGHT

“須菩提! 於意云何?若人滿三千大千世 界七寶以用布施，是人所得福德，寧為多不?”

須菩提言: “甚多，世尊! 何以故? 是福德即非福德性，是故如來說福德多.”

“若復有人‚ 於此經中受持‚ 乃至四句偈等‚ 為他人說，其福勝彼.何以故? 須菩提! 一切諸佛，及諸佛阿耨多羅三藐三菩提 法，皆從此經出.須菩提!所謂佛法者‚ 即非佛法."

“Subhuti! What do you think? If someone filled a three thousand great thousand world-system with the seven treasures and used it all to practice giving, this person would obtain great merit, would they not?”

Subhuti said: “Extremely great, World-Honored One! Why? Because this merit does not have the nature of merit, for this reason, the Thus Come One says the merit is great.”

“If, however, there was someone who, from this sutra, received and retained even just four lines of verse and explained them to others, this person’s merit would surpass that. Why? Subhuti! Each and every buddha and all *buddha-anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi-dharma* come from this sutra. Subhuti! What has been called Buddha Dharma is not Buddha Dharma.”

## CHAPTER NINE

“須菩提!於意云何? 須陀洹能作是念: ‘我得須陀洹果.’ 不?”

須菩提言:“不也，世尊!何以故?須陀 洹名為入流，而無所入，不入色，聲‚ 香，味，觸，法，是名須陀洹.”

“須菩提!於意云何?斯陀含能作是念: ‘我得斯陀含果.’ 不?”

須菩提言:“不也，世尊!何以故?斯陀 含名一往來，而實無往來，是名斯陀含.”

“須菩提!於意云何?阿那含能作是念: ‘我得阿那含果.’不?”

須菩提言:“不也，世尊!何以故?阿那 含名為不來，而實無來，是故名阿那含.”

“須菩提!於意云何?阿羅漢能作是念: ‘我得阿羅漢道.’不?”

須菩提言:“不也，世尊!何以故?實無 有法名阿羅漢.世尊!若阿羅漢作是念: ‘我得阿羅漢道.’即為著我，人，眾生‚ 壽者.世尊!佛說我得無諍三昧人中最 為第一，是第一離欲阿羅漢. 我不作是念: ‘我是離欲阿羅漢.’ 世尊! 我若作是念: ‘我 得阿羅漢道.’ 世尊則不說須菩提是樂阿蘭 那行者.以須菩提實無所行，而名須菩 提是樂阿蘭那行.”

“Subhuti! What do you think? Is a [śrotāpanna (stream-enterer)](https://www.notion.so/rot-panna-stream-enterer-613bac21cf78424f81ce5cedabe00ec1?pvs=21) able to have this thought, ‘I have obtained the fruit of a [śrotāpanna](https://www.notion.so/rot-panna-stream-enterer-613bac21cf78424f81ce5cedabe00ec1?pvs=21),’ or not?”

Subhuti replied: “No, World-Honored One! Why? [Śrotāpannas](https://www.notion.so/rot-panna-stream-enterer-613bac21cf78424f81ce5cedabe00ec1?pvs=21) are named for entering the stream, yet there is nowhere to enter.

“Subhuti! What do you think? Is a [sakŗdāgāmin (once-returner)](https://www.notion.so/sak-d-g-min-once-returner-1d7bb7e7e0b34bf48e14610df00c0124?pvs=21) able to have this thought, ‘I have obtained the fruit of a [sakŗdāgāmin](https://www.notion.so/sak-d-g-min-once-returner-1d7bb7e7e0b34bf48e14610df00c0124?pvs=21),’ or not?”

Subhuti replied: “No, World-Honored One! Why? [Sakŗdāgāmins](https://www.notion.so/sak-d-g-min-once-returner-1d7bb7e7e0b34bf48e14610df00c0124?pvs=21) are named for returning once again, yet, in reality, there is no returning once again. This is called a [sakŗdāgāmin](https://www.notion.so/sak-d-g-min-once-returner-1d7bb7e7e0b34bf48e14610df00c0124?pvs=21).”

“Subhuti! What do you think? Is the [anāgāmin (non-returner)](https://www.notion.so/an-g-min-non-returner-84893a6d8e3040e5b3b2d0b92375fc59?pvs=21) able to have this thought, ‘I have obtained the fruit of an [anāgāmin](https://www.notion.so/an-g-min-non-returner-84893a6d8e3040e5b3b2d0b92375fc59?pvs=21),’ or not?”

Subhuti replied: “No, World-Honored One! Why? [Anāgāmins](https://www.notion.so/an-g-min-non-returner-84893a6d8e3040e5b3b2d0b92375fc59?pvs=21) are named for not returning.

“Subhuti! What do you think? Is an [arhat (worthy one)](https://www.notion.so/arhat-worthy-one-b8950791fb3d475087ca6fc8080b3c48?pvs=21) able to have this thought, ‘I have obtained the Way of an [arahat](https://www.notion.so/arhat-worthy-one-b8950791fb3d475087ca6fc8080b3c48?pvs=21)’ or not?”

Subhuti replied: “No, World-Honored One! Why is this? In reality, there is no dharma called an [arahat](https://www.notion.so/arhat-worthy-one-b8950791fb3d475087ca6fc8080b3c48?pvs=21). World-Honored! If arahats had this thought, ‘I have obtained the Way of an [arahat](https://www.notion.so/arhat-worthy-one-b8950791fb3d475087ca6fc8080b3c48?pvs=21),’ then they become attached to a self, an individual, a sentient being, and a living thing. World Honored-One! The Buddha says I have attained the indisputable [samādhi](https://www.notion.so/sam-dhi-f7bfffbdd74d4cef9ecb3cadbd11c645?pvs=21), that I am first and foremost among men, foremost [arahat](https://www.notion.so/arhat-worthy-one-b8950791fb3d475087ca6fc8080b3c48?pvs=21) freed from desire. World Honored-One! I do not have this thought: ‘I am an [arahat](https://www.notion.so/arhat-worthy-one-b8950791fb3d475087ca6fc8080b3c48?pvs=21) freed from desire.’ World-Honored One! If I had this thought, ‘I have obtained the Way of an [arahat](https://www.notion.so/arhat-worthy-one-b8950791fb3d475087ca6fc8080b3c48?pvs=21),’ then the World Honored-One would not have said, Subhuti is the one who enjoys [aranya (forest)](https://www.notion.so/aranya-forest-e83be5f667724d90a8698f1eb7d94261?pvs=21) practice. Since, in reality, Subhuti has nothing to practice, he is called Subhuti, the one who enjoys araṇya practice.”

## CHAPTER TEN

佛告須菩提:“於意云何?如來昔在然燈 佛所，於法有所得不?”

“世尊!如來在然燈佛所，於法實無所得.”

“須菩提! 於意云何?菩薩莊嚴佛土不?”

“不也，世尊!何以故?莊嚴佛土者，則 非莊嚴，是名莊嚴.”

“是故須菩提，諸菩薩摩訶薩應如是生清淨心，不應住色生心，不應住聲，香‚ 味，觸，法生心，應無所住而生其心.”

“須菩提! 譬如有人，身如須彌山王，於 意云何?是身為大不?”

須菩提言:“甚大，世尊!何以故?佛說 非身，是名大身.”

The Buddha told Subhuti: “What do you think? When the Thus Come One was with Dīpaṃkara Buddha, was there some dharma attained, or not?”

“World-Honored One! When the Thus Come One was with Dīpaṃkara Buddha, in reality, there was no dharma attained.”

“Subhuti! What do you think? Bodhisattvas adorn Buddha Lands, do they not?”

“No, World Honored-One! Why is this? The adornments of a Buddha Land are not adornments, they are called adornments.”

“For this reason, Subhuti, all bodhisattva mahāsattvas should produce a stainless mind this way; they should not abide in sights to produce this mind, they should not abide in sounds or scents, flavors, feelings or thoughts to produce this mind. They should not abide in anything in order to produce this mind.”

“Subhuti! Suppose someone had a body like the King of Mountains, Sumeru. What do you think? Would that body be great, or not?”

Subhuti said:, “Extremely great, World-Honored One! Why? The Buddha says that which is not a body is called a great body.”

## CHAPTER ELEVEN

“須菩提! 如恒河中所有沙數，如是沙等 恒河，於意云何?是諸恒河沙寧為多 不?”

須菩提言: “甚多，世尊!但諸恒河尚多 無數，何況其沙.”

“須菩提!我今實言告汝.若有善男子‚ 善女人，以七寶滿爾所恒河沙數三千大 千世界，以用布施，得福多不?”

須菩提言:“甚多，世尊!”

佛告須菩提:“若善男子，善女人，於此 經中，乃至受持四句偈等，為他人說‚ 而此福德勝前福德.”

“Subhuti! If there were as many Ganges Rivers as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River, what do you think? Would the grains of sand in all these Ganges Rivers be many, or not?”

Subhuti replied: “Very many, World Honored-One! Just the Ganges River alone would have an incalculable amount. How much more so this sand.”

“Subhuti! I now truly ask you. If there are virtuous men and women who use the seven treasures and fill as many three thousand great thousand world-systems as there are grains of sand in all those Ganges Rivers and use it all to practice giving, the merit they obtain would be great, would it not?”

Subhuti replied: “Extremely great, World-Honored One!”

The Buddha told Subhuti: “If virtuous men and women, who from this sutra, receive and retain even just four lines of verse, and explain them to another, the merit obtained will surpass the aforementioned merit.”

## CHAPTER TWELVE

“復次，須菩提!隨說是經，乃至四句偈 等，當知此處，一切世間天，人，阿修 羅，皆應供養，如佛塔廟，何況有人盡 能受持讀誦.須菩提!當知是人成就最 上第一希有之法，若是經典所在之處, 則為有佛，若尊重弟子.”

“Furthermore, Subhuti! Following an explanation of this sutra, if even just four lines of verse, you should know, at that place all heavenly beings and asuras of all realms will make offerings as if it were a Buddha reliquary. How much more so if someone is able to receive, retain, read, and recite it completely. Subhuti! You should know this person has achieved the supreme, foremost, rare Dharma and, wherever this sutra discourse is located, there will be a buddha and an honorable disciple.”

## CHAPTER THIRTEEN

爾時，須菩提白佛言:“世尊!當何名此 經?我等云何奉持?”

佛告須菩提:“是經名為 ‘金剛般若波羅 蜜’.以是名字，汝當奉持.所以者何? 須菩提!佛說若波羅蜜，則非般若波 羅蜜.須菩提!於意云何?如來有所說 法不?”

須菩提白佛言:“世尊!如來無所說.”

“須菩提!於意云何?三千大千世界所有 微塵是為多不?”

須菩提言:“甚多，世尊!”

“須菩提!諸微塵，如來說非微塵，是名 微塵.如來說世界，非世界，是名世界.”

“須菩提!於意云何?可以三十二相見如 來不?”

“不也，世尊!不可以三十二相得見如來. 何以故?如來說三十二相，即是非相‚ 是名三十二相.”

“須菩提!若有善男子，善女人，以恒河 沙等身命布施; 若復有人，於此經中，乃 至受持四句偈等，為他人說，其福甚多.”

At that time, Subhuti addressed the Buddha saying: “World Honored-One! What is the name of this sutra? How should I respectfully uphold it?”

The Buddha told Subhuti: “This sutra is called *Vajra Prajñāpāramitā*. You should respectfully uphold it by this name. Why? Subhuti! The Buddha says *prajñāpāramitā* is not *prajñāpāramitā*. Subhuti! What do you think? Does the Thus Come One speak the Dharma, or not?”

Subhuti addressed the Buddha saying: “World Honored-One! The Thus Come One has not said anything at all.”

“Subhuti! What do you think? A three thousand great thousand world-system contains many minute particles, does it not?”

Subhuti replied: “Extremely many, World Honored- One!”

“Subhuti! All minute particles, the Thus Come One says, are not minute particles, they are called minute particles. The Thus Come One says a world-system is not a world-system, it is called a world-system.”

“Subhuti! What do you think? Can the thirty-two auspicious characteristics be used to see the Thus Come One, or not?”

“No, World Honored-One! You cannot use the thirty-two characteristics to see the Thus Come One. Why? The Thus Come One says the thirty-two characteristics are not characteristics, they are called the thirty-two characteristics.”

“Subhuti! If there are virtuous men and women who practice giving lives equal to the sands in the Ganges River; if, however, there is someone who, from this sutra, retains only four lines of verse and explains them to another, the merit would be much greater.”

## CHAPTER FOURTEEN

爾時，須菩提聞說是經，深解義趣，涕 淚悲泣，而白佛言:“希有!世尊!佛說 如是甚深經典，我從昔來所得慧眼，未 曾得聞如是之經.世尊!若復有人得聞 是經，信心清淨，則生實相，當知是人 成就第一希有功德.世尊!是實相者‚ 則是非相，是故如來說名實相.世尊! 我今得聞如是經典，信解受持不足為 難，若當來世，後五百歲，其有眾生‚ 得聞是經，信解受持，是人則為第一希 有.何以故?此人無我相，人相，眾生 相，壽者相.所以者何?我相即是非 相，人相，眾生相，壽者相即是非相. 何 以故?離一切諸相，則名諸佛.”

When Subhuti heard this sutra spoken, he penetrated its meaning and, weeping with lament, addressed the Buddha saying: “Most rare! World Honored-One! The Buddha has spoken such an extremely profound sutra. Ever since I first obtained the Wisdom Eye, not once have I heard such a sutra. World Honored-One! If there are also people able to hear this sutra, their confident mind will be stainless, giving rise to the Characteristic of Reality. You should know these people achieve a foremost, rare merit. World Honored-One! This Characteristic of Reality is without any characteristic. For this reason, the Thus Come One says it is called the Characteristic of Reality. World Honored-One! Now that I am able to hear a sutra such as this, I believe, understand, receive and retain it without much difficulty. If, in times to come, after five hundred years, there are sentient beings able to hear this sutra, believing, understanding, receiving and retaining it, then these people are the foremost rare. Why? These people are without the characteristics of a self, individuality, sentience, or life. Why? The characteristic of a self is not a characteristic. The characteristics of individuality, sentience, and life are not characteristics. Why? Being free of all characteristics is called Buddha.”

佛告須菩提:“如是，如是!若復有人得 聞是經，不驚，不怖，不畏，當知是人 甚為希有.何以故?須菩提!如來說第 一波羅蜜，非第一波羅蜜，是名第一波 羅蜜.須菩提!忍辱波羅蜜，如來說非 忍辱波羅蜜.何以故?須菩提!如我昔 為歌利王割截身體，我於爾時，無我 相，無人相，無眾生相，無壽者相.何 以故?我於往昔節節支解時，若有我 相，人相，眾生相，壽者相，應生瞋恨. 須菩提!又念過去於五百世作忍辱仙 人，於爾所世，無我相，無人相，無眾 生相，無壽者相.是故須菩提!菩薩應 離一切相，發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心‚ 不應住色生心，不應住聲，香，味‚ 觸，法生心，應生無所住心.若心有 住，則為非住.是故佛說: ‘菩薩心不應 住色布施.”

The Buddha told Subhuti: “So it is, so it is! If there are also people able to hear this sutra, and they are not alarmed, not afraid, and not awed, you should know these people are extremely rare. Why? Subhuti! The Thus Come One says the foremost *pāramitā* is not the foremost *pāramitā*, it is called the foremost *pāramitā*. Subhuti! The *pāramitā* of patience, the Thus Come One says, is not the *pāramitā* of patience. Why? Subhuti! It is like when the King of Kalinga mutilated my body. I was, at that time, without the characteristics of a self, individuality, sentience or life. Why? While abiding thus, being dismembered joint by joint, if I had the characteristics of a self, individuality, sentience, or life, I would have given rise to anger and hatred. Subhuti! I also recall going through five hundred lifetimes as an ascetic practicing patience. During those lifetimes, I was without the characteristics of a self, individuality, sentience or life. For this reason, Subhuti! Bodhisattvas should be free from all characteristics and develop the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. They should not abide in sights to produce this mind. They should not abide in sounds, scents, flavors, feelings or thoughts to produce this mind. They should produce a mind that does not abide in anything. If the mind possesses an abode, then there is not abiding. For this reason, the Buddha says: ‘The mind of the bodhisattva should not abide in forms when practicing giving.’”

“須菩提! 菩薩為利益一切眾生，應如是 布施.如來說:‘一切諸相，即是非相.’ 又說:‘一切眾生，則非眾生.’”

“Subhuti! Since bodhisattvas benefit all sentient beings, they should practice giving like this. The Thus Come One says: ‘All characteristics are not characteristics,’ and also says: ‘All sentient beings are not sentient beings.’”

“須菩提! 如來是真語者，實語者，如語 者，不誑語者，不異語者.”

“Subhuti! The Thus Come One speaks what is true, what is real and what is so, what is not deceptive and not altered.”

“須菩提! 如來所得法，此法無實無虛."

“Subhuti! The Dharma attained by the Thus Come One, this Dharma is neither real nor unreal."

須菩提! 若菩薩心住於法而行布施，如 人入闇，則無所見;若菩薩心不住法而 行布施，如人有目，日光明照，見種種 色.”

"Subhuti! If the mind of a bodhisattva abides in dharmas when practicing giving, it is like someone entering the dark, without anything to see. If the mind of a bodhisattva does not rely on dharmas, and they practice giving, it is like someone with brightly illuminated eyes seeing all kinds of sights.”

“須菩提! 當來之世，若有善男子，善女人，能於此經受持讀誦，則為如來以佛 智慧，悉知是人，悉見是人，皆得成就 無量無邊功德.”

“Subhuti! In ages to come, if there are virtuous men and women able to retain and recite this sutra, then the Thus Come One, by means of the Wisdom of the Buddha, fully knows and fully sees these people all achieve immeasurable, illimitable merit.”

## CHAPTER FIFTEEN

“須菩提!若有善男子，善女人，初日分 以恒河沙等身布施，中日分復以恒河沙 等身布施，後日分亦以恒河沙等身布 施，如是無量百千萬億劫以身布施;若 復有人聞此經典，信心不逆，其福勝 彼，何況書寫，受持，讀誦，為人解 說?”

“Subhuti! If virtuous men and women, at the beginning part of the day, with as many lives as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River, practice giving and, in the middle part of the day, with as many lives as grains of sand in the Ganges River, practice giving and, in the latter part of the day, with as many lives as grains of sand in the Ganges River, practice giving like this, for immeasurable, hundreds of thousands of tens-of-thousands of millions of kalpas, with their lives, practicing giving; if, however, someone hears this sutra, their mind confident, not disputing it, the merit will surpass that. How much more so for recording, receiving, and reciting it, and explaining it to others?”

“須菩提!以要言之，是經有不可思議‚ 不可稱量，無邊功德.如來為發大乘者 說，為發最上乘者說.若有人能受持讀 誦，廣為人說，如來悉知是人，悉見是 人，皆得成就不可量，不可稱，無有 邊，不可思議功德，如是人等，則為荷 擔如來阿耨多羅三藐三菩提.何以故? 須菩提!若樂小法者，著我見，人見‚ 眾生見，壽者見，則於此經，不能聽受 讀誦，為人解說.”

“Subhuti! Essentially speaking, this sutra has inconceivable, immeasurable, illimitable merit. The Thus Come One has spoken it for those who have embarked on the Great Vehicle, for those who have embarked on the Supreme Vehicle. If there are people able to retain and recite it, and explain it widely to others, the Thus Come One fully knows these people, fully sees these people all achieving immeasurable, indescribable, illimitable, inconceivable merit. People like this will then bare the *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi* of the Thus Come One. Why? Subhuti! If there are those who enjoy a lesser Dharma, they are attached to the view of a self, the view of an individual, the view of a sentient being, and the view of a living thing, and will be unable to hear and retain this sutra, or explain it to others.”

“須菩提!在在處處，若有此經，一切世 間天，人，阿修羅，所應供養;當知此 處則為是塔，皆應恭敬，作禮圍繞，以 諸華香而散其處.”

“Subhuti! Wherever there is this sutra, heavenly beings, humans and asuras of all worldly realms will make offerings; you should know this place will then become a reliquary, and they will all reverentially make obeisance, circumambulating it, spreading all kinds of flowers and incense here.”

## CHAPTER SIXTEEN

“復次，須菩提！善男子，善女人，受持讀誦此經，若為人輕賤，是人先世罪業, 應墮惡道，以今世人輕賤故，先世罪業 則為消滅，當得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提.”

“Furthermore, Subhuti! Virtuous men and women who retain and recite this sutra, if they are disdained by others, whatever karmic offenses from their former lives that should have sent them on an evil path, due to this disdain by others, their former lives’ karmic offenses will then be eradicated and they are certain to attain *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi.*”

“須菩提！我念過去無量阿僧祇劫，於然燈佛前，得值八百四千萬億那由他諸佛,
悉皆供養承事，無空過者；若復有人, 於後末世，能受持讀誦此經，所得功德, 於 我 所 供 養 諸 佛 功德， 百 分 不 及 一 , 千萬億分，乃至算數譬喻所不能及.”

“Subhuti! I recall in the past, immeasurable, *asaṃkhya* kalpas before Dīpaṃkara Buddha, I was able to meet eighty-four thousand million *nayutas* of buddhas, making offerings to them all, attending to them without neglect or fault; if, however, there are people in latter times of decline able to retain and recite this sutra, the merit I obtained from making offerings to all those buddhas is not even one hundredth of their merit, not even one thousandth, one ten-thousandth, one millionth, nor even is a calculation or comparison able to be reached.”

“須菩提！若善男子，善女人，於後末世, 有受持讀誦此經，所得功德，我若具說者，或有人聞，心則狂亂，狐疑不信, 須菩提！當知是經義不可思議，果報亦不可思議.”

“Subhuti! If virtuous men and women in latter times of decline retain and recite this sutra, the merit they will obtain, if I fully explained it, some people may hear and their minds would be confounded, suspicious, and untrusting. Subhuti! You should know, the meaning of this sutra is inconceivable, and its fruition is also inconceivable.”

## CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

爾時，須菩提白佛言：“世尊！善男子, 善女人，發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，云
何應住？云何降伏其心?”

At that time, Subhuti addressed the Buddha saying: “World Honored-One! Virtuous men and women who develop the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*, how should they abide? How can they master their mind?”

佛告須菩提：“善男子，善女人，發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提者，當生如是心：‘我應
滅度一切眾生．滅度一切眾生已，而無有一眾生實滅度者.’ 何以故？須菩提!
若菩薩有我相，人相，眾生相，壽者相, 則非菩薩．所以者何？須菩提！實無有
法發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提者.”

The Buddha told Subhuti: “Virtuous men and women who develop the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi* should give rise to a mind like this: ‘I must liberate all sentient beings, yet, after liberating all sentient beings, there is not a single sentient being really liberated.’ Why? Subhuti! If bodhisattvas possess the characteristics of a self, an individual, a sentient being, or a living thing, then they are not bodhisattvas. By what reason? Subhuti! In reality, there is no dharma that is the development of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*.”

“須菩提！於意云何？如來於然燈佛所, 有法得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提不?”

“Subhuti, what do you think? While the Thus Come One was with Dīpaṃkara Buddha, some dharma was attained that was *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*, was there not?”

“不也，世尊！如我解佛所說義，佛於然燈佛所，無有法得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提.”

“There was not, World Honored-One! As I understand the meaning of what the Buddha said, while the Buddha was with Dīpaṃkara Buddha, there was no dharma attained that was *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*."

佛言：“如是，如是！須菩提！實無有法, 如來得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提．須菩提!
若有法如來得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提者, 然燈佛則不與我受記：‘汝於來世，當得
作佛，號釋迦牟尼.’ 以實無有法得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提，是故然燈佛與我受記,
作是言:’ 汝於來世，當得作佛，號釋迦牟尼.’ 何以故？如來者，即諸法如義.”

The Buddha said: “So it is, so it is! Subhuti! In reality, there is no dharma the Thus Come One attained that is *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. Subhuti! If there was a dharma the Thus Come One attained that was *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*, then Dīpaṃkara Buddha would not have predicted of me: ‘In a future life you will attain buddhahood and be called Śakyamuni.’ Since, in reality, there is no dharma attained that is *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*, this is why Dīpaṃkara Buddha predicted of me saying: ‘In a future life you will attain Buddhahood and be called Śakyamuni.’ Why? Thus Come One means the suchness of all dharmas.”

“若有人言：‘如來得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提.’ 須菩提！實無有法，佛得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提．須菩提! 如來所得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提，於是中無實無虛.是故如來說: ‘一切法皆是佛法.’ 須菩提！所言一切法者，即非一切法，是故名一切法.”

“If there are people who say: ‘The Thus Come One attains *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*.’ Subhuti! In reality there is no dharma the Buddha attains that is *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. Subhuti! The Thus Come One attains *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi* in which there is neither reality nor falsehood. For this reason, the Thus Come One says: ‘All dharmas are Buddha Dharma.’ Subhuti! What are said to be all dharmas are not all dharmas. For this reason, they are called all dharmas.”

“須菩提！譬如人身長大.”

“Subhuti! Suppose someone had a very large body.”

須菩提言：“世尊！如來說人身長大，則
為非大身，是名大身.”

Subhuti said: “World Honored-One! What the Thus Come One says is someone’s very large body is not a large body, it is called a large body.”

“須菩提！菩薩亦如是．若作是言：‘我當滅度無量眾生.’ 則不名菩薩．何以故？須菩提！實無有法名為菩薩．是故佛說: ‘一切法無我，無人，無眾生，無壽者.’
須菩提！若菩薩作是言：‘我當莊嚴佛土.’ 是不名菩薩．何以故？如來說莊嚴佛
土者，即非莊嚴，是名莊嚴．須菩提! 若菩薩通達無我法者，如來說名真是菩
薩.”

“Subhuti! Bodhisattvas are also like this. If they make this statement: ‘I will liberate immeasurable sentient beings,’ then they are not called bodhisattvas. Why? Subhuti! In reality there is no dharma called a bodhisattva. For this reason, the Buddha says: ‘All dharmas are without a self, individuality, sentience, or life.’ Subhuti! If bodhisattvas make this statement: ‘I will adorn Buddha lands,’ they are not called bodhisattvas. Why? The Thus Come One says the adornments of a Buddha land are not adornments,  they are called adornments. Subhuti! If bodhisattvas penetrate the selflessness of all dharmas, the Thus Come One says this is called truly being a bodhisattva.”

## CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

“須菩提！於意云何？如來有肉眼不?”

“Subhuti! What do you think? Does the Thus Come One have physical eyes, or not?”

“如是，世尊！如來有肉眼.”

“So it is, World Honored-One! The Thus Come One has physical eyes.”

“須菩提！於意云何？如來有天眼不?”

“Subhuti! What do you think? Does the Thus Come One have the Divine Eye, or not?”

“如是，世尊！如來有天眼.”

“So it is, World Honored-One! The Thus Come One has the Divine Eye.”

“須菩提！於意云何？如來有慧眼不?”

“Subhuti! What do you think? Does the Thus Come One have the Wisdom Eye, or not?”

“如是，世尊！如來有慧眼.”

“So it is, World Honored-One! The Thus Come One has the Wisdom Eye.”

“須菩提！於意云何？如來有法眼不?”

“Subhuti! What do you think? Does the Thus Come One have the Dharma eye, or not?”

“如是，世尊！如來有法眼.”

“So it is, World Honored-One! The Thus Come One has the Dharma Eye.”

“須菩提！於意云何？如來有佛眼不?”

“Subhuti! What do you think? Does the Thus Come One have the Buddha Eye, or not?”

“如是，世尊！如來有佛眼.”

“So it is, World Honored-One! The Thus Come One has the Buddha Eye.”

“ 須 菩 提 ！ 於 意 云 何 ？ 恒 河 中 所 有 沙 ‚ 佛說是沙不?”

“Subhuti! What do you think? As for all the sand in the Ganges River, has the Buddha spoken of this sand, or not?”

“如是，世尊！如來說是沙.”

“So it is, World-Honored One! The Thus Come One has spoken of this sand.”

“須菩提！於意云何？如一恒河中所有沙‚ 有如是等恒河，是諸恒河所有沙數佛世界，如是寧為多不?”

“Subhuti! What do you think? If there were as many Ganges Rivers as there are grains of sand in a single Ganges River, and as many buddha lands as the grains of sand in all those Ganges Rivers, would this be many, or not?”

“甚多，世尊!”

“Extremely many, World Honored-One!”

佛告須菩提：“爾所國土中，所有眾生‚ 若干種心，如來悉知，何以故？如來說諸心，皆為非心，是名為心，所以者何?

The Buddha told Subhuti: “The sentient beings within all those lands, of whatever type of mind, the Thus Come One fully knows them all. Why? The Thus Come One says all minds are not minds, they are called minds. Why?

須菩提！過去心不可得，現在心不可得，未來心不可得.”

Subhuti! The past mind cannot be obtained. A present mind cannot be obtained. The future mind cannot be obtained.”

## CHAPTER NINETEEN

“須菩提！於意云何？若有人滿三千大千世界七寶以用布施‚ 是人以是因緣‚ 得福多不?”

“Subhuti! What do you think? If someone filled a three thousand great thousand world-system with the seven treasures and used it to practice giving, the merit this person would obtain as a consequence would be great, would it not?”

“如是‚ 世尊! 此人以是因緣‚ 得福甚多.”

“So it is, World Honored-One! The merit this person would obtain as a consequence would be great.”

“須菩提！若福德有實，如來不說得福德多；以福德無故，如來說得福德多.”

Subhuti! “If this merit was real, the Thus Come One would not have said the merit obtained is great; due to the nonexistence of merit, the Thus Come One says the merit obtained is great.”

## CHAPTER TWENTY

“須菩提！於意云何？佛可以具足色身見不?”

“Subhuti! “What do you think? Can the Buddha be seen as having a perfectly formed body, or not?”

“不也，世尊！如來不應以具足色身見. 何以故？如來說具足色身，即非具足色身，是名具足色身.”

“No, World Honored-One! The Thus Come One should not be seen as having a perfectly formed body. Why? The Thus Come One says a perfectly formed body is not a perfectly formed body, it is called a perfectly formed body.”

“須菩提！於意云何？如來可以具足諸相見不?”

“Subhuti! What do you think? Can the Thus Come One be seen as having all perfect characteristics, or not?”

“不也，世尊！如來不應以具足諸相見. 何以故？如來說諸相具足，即非具足‚是名諸相具足.”

“No, World Honored-One! The Thus Come One should not be seen as having all perfect characteristics. Why? The perfection of all characteristics that the Thus Come One speaks of is not perfection, it is called the perfection of all characteristics.”

## CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE

“須菩提！汝勿謂如來作是念：‘我當有所說法.’ 莫作是念，何以故？若人言：‘如
來有所說法.’ 即為謗，不能解我所說故."

“Subhuti! You should not claim the Thus Come One has this thought: ‘I must speak the Dharma.’ Do not have this thought. Why? If someone says the Thus Come One has spoken the Dharma, then they slander the Buddha, unable to understand what I have said.

"須菩提！說法者，無法可說，是名說法.”

Subhuti! In speaking the Dharma, there is nothing that can be said, this is called speaking the Dharma.”

爾時，慧命須菩提白佛言：“世尊！頗有眾生，於未來世，聞說是法，生信心
不?”

At that time, the Wise Subhuti addressed the Buddha saying: “World Honored-One! There are many sentient beings in their future lives who, hearing this Dharma spoken, will produce a confident mind, are there not?”

佛言：“須菩提！彼非眾生，非不眾生. 何以故？須菩提！眾生，眾生者，如來
說非眾生，是名眾生.”

The Buddha said: “Subhuti! There are neither sentient beings nor non-sentient beings. Why? Subhuti! Sentient beings, the Thus Come One says, are not sentient beings, they are called sentient beings.”

## CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO

須菩提白佛言：“世尊！佛得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提，為無所得耶?”

Subhuti addressed the Buddha saying: “World Honored-One! Does the Buddha attain *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi* without attaining anything?”

“如是，如是！須菩提！我於阿耨多羅三藐三菩提乃至無有少法可得，是名阿耨
多羅三藐三菩提.”

“So it is, so it is! Subhuti! Regarding my *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*, there is not even the least dharma that can be attained, this is called *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*.”

## CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE

“復次，須菩提！是法平等，無有高下‚ 是名阿耨多羅三藐三菩提；以無我，無
人，無眾生，無壽者，修一切善法，則得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提．須菩提！所言
善法者，如來說非善法，是名善法.”

“Furthermore, Subhuti! This Dharma is equanimous and without variance, so it is called *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*; being without self, individuality, sentience or life in the cultivation of all virtuous Dharma, one attains *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. Subhuti! What is said to be virtuous Dharma, the Thus Come One says, is not virtuous Dharma, it is called virtuous Dharma.”

## CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR

“須菩提！若三千大千世界中所有諸須彌山王，如是等七寶聚，有人持用布施; 若人以此般若波羅蜜經，乃至四句偈等‚ 受持讀誦，為他人說，於前福德百分不及一，百千萬億分，乃至算數譬喻所不能及.”

“Subhuti! If there were piles of the seven treasures equal to all the Sumeru mountain kings within a three thousand great thousand world-system, and someone used it all to practice giving; and if someone retains and recites this *Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra*, even just four lines, and tells it to others, the previous merit is not even one hundredth, one thousandth, one ten-thousandth, one millionth, nor even is a calculation or comparison of it able to be reached.”

## CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE

“須菩提！於意云何？汝等勿謂如來作是念：‘我當度眾生.’須菩提！莫作是念. 何以故？實無有眾生如來度者，若有眾生如來度者，如來則有我，人，眾生, 壽者．須菩提！如來說：‘有我者，則非有我，而凡夫之人以為有我.’ 須菩提! 凡夫者，如來說則非凡夫.”

“Subhuti! What do you think? You should not claim the Thus Come One has this thought: ‘I will liberate sentient beings.’ Subhuti! Do not have this thought. Why? In reality, there are no sentient beings the Thus Come One liberates. If there were sentient beings the Thus Come One liberates, the Thus Come One would then possess a self, individuality, sentience, and life. Subhuti! The Thus Come One says: ‘The existent self is not an existent self, however ordinary people think there is an existent self.’ Subhuti! The ordinary, the Thus Come One says, is not ordinary.”

## CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX

“須菩提！於意云何？可以三十二相觀如來不?”

“Subhuti! What do you think? Can the Thus Come One be perceived by the thirty-two characteristics, or not?”

須菩提言：“如是，如是! 以三十二相觀如來.”

Subhuti said: “So it is, so it is! The Thus Come One is perceived by the thirty-two characteristics.”

佛言：“須菩提！若以三十二相觀如來者‚ 轉輪聖王則是如來.”

The Buddha said: “Subhuti! If one perceives the Thus Come One by the thirty-two characteristics, then a wheel-turning sage king is the Thus Come One.”

須菩提白佛言：“世尊！如我解佛所說義‚ 不應以三十二相觀如來.”

Subhuti addressed the Buddha saying: “World Honored-One! As I understand the meaning of what the Buddha has said, the Thus Come One should not be perceived by the thirty-two characteristics.”

爾時，世尊而說偈言：
    若以色見我‚
    以音聲求我‚
    是人行邪道‚
    不能見如來.

At that time, the World Honored-One spoke a verse saying:

If I am seen by sight,
Or if I am sought by sound,
This person walks the wrong path,
Unable to see the Thus Come One.

## CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN

“須菩提！汝若作是念：‘如來不以具足相故，得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提.’ 須菩提! 莫作是念．如來不以具足相故，得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提.

“Subhuti! If you have this thought: ‘It is not due to the perfection of characteristics that the Thus Come One attains *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*.’ Subhuti! Do not have this thought, 'It is not due to the perfection of characteristics that the Thus Come One attains *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*.'”

“須菩提！汝若作是念：‘發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提者‚說諸法斷滅相.’ 莫作是念. 何以故？發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心者‚ 於法不說斷滅相.”

“Subhuti! If you have this thought: ‘One who develops *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi* says all dharmas have the characteristic of annihilation.’ Do not have this thought. Why? One who develops the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi* does not say dharmas have the characteristic of annihilation.”

## CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT

“須菩提！若菩薩以滿恒河沙等世界七寶布施；若復有人知一切法無我，得成於忍‚ 此菩薩勝前菩薩所得功德．須菩提！以諸菩薩不受福德故.”

“Subhuti! If a bodhisattva filled as many three thousand great thousand world-systems as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River with the seven treasures and used it all to practice giving; and if, however, there is someone who knows all dharmas are selfless, achieving patience, this bodhisattva
surpasses the merit obtained by the aforementioned bodhisattva. Subhuti! This is because all bodhisattvas do not receive merit.”

須菩提白佛言：“世尊！云何菩薩不受福德?”

Subhuti addressed the Buddha saying: “World Honored-One! Why do you say bodhisattvas do not receive merit?”

“須菩提！菩薩所作福德，不應貪著，是故說不受福德.”

“Subhuti! The merit made by bodhisattvas should not be desired. For this reason, it is said they do not receive merit.”

## CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE

“須菩提！若有人言：‘如來若來若去‚ 若坐若臥.’是人不解我所說義．何以故? 如來者，無所從來，亦無所去，故名如來.”

“Subhuti! If someone says: ‘The Thus Come One comes and goes, sits and lies down,’ this person does not understand the meaning of what I say. Why? That which arrives thusly has nowhere to come from and nowhere to go, and is therefore called the Thus Come One.”

## CHAPTER THIRTY

“須菩提！若善男子，善女人，以三千大千世界碎為微塵，於意云何？是微塵眾
寧為多不?”

“Subhuti! If a virtuous man or woman were to grind a three thousand great thousand world-system into minute particles, what do you think? This mass of minute particles would be large, would it not?”

“甚多，世尊！何以故？若是微塵眾實有者，佛則不說是微塵眾．所以者何?
佛說微塵眾，則非微塵，是名微塵眾. 世尊！如來所說三千大千世界，則非世
界，是名世界．何以故？若世界實有者, 則是一合相．如來說一合相，則非一合
相，是名一合相.”

“Extremely large, World Honored-One! Why? If this mass of minute particles really existed, then the Buddha would not have spoken of a mass of minute particles. By what reason? The Buddha says a mass of minute particles is not a mass of minute particles, it is called a mass of minute particles. World Honored One! The Thus Come One has said a three thousand great thousand world-system is not a world-system, it is called a world-system. Why? If a three thousand great thousand world-system really existed then it would have the characteristic of being a unified entity. The Thus Come One says the characteristic of being a unified entity is not a unified entity, it is called a unified entity.”

“須菩提！一合相者，則是不可說, 但凡夫之人貪著其事.”

“Subhuti! A unified entity cannot be spoken of. Only ordinary people are attached to such things.”

## CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE

“須菩提！若人言：‘佛說我見，人見, 眾生見，壽者見.’ 須菩提! 於意云何?
是人解我所說義不?”

“Subhuti! If someone says, ‘The Buddha speaks of a view of a self, individuality, sentience, and life.’
Subhuti! What do you think? Does this person understand the meaning of what I say, or not?”

“世尊！是人不解如來所說義. 何以故? 世尊說我見，人見，眾生見，壽者見‚
即 非 我 見 ， 人 見 ， 眾 生 見 ， 壽 者 見 ‚ 是名我見，人見，眾生見，壽者見.”

“World-Honored One! This person does not understand the meaning of what the Thus Come One has said. Why? The World-Honored One says the view of a self, an individual, a sentient being, or a life are not views of a self, individuality, sentience, and life, they are called the views of a self, individuality, sentience, and life.”

“須菩提！發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心者‚ 於一切法，應如是知，如是見，如是信
解，不生法相．須菩提！所言法相者‚ 如來說即非法相，是名法相.”

“Subhuti! Those who develop the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*, regarding all dharmas, they should know like this, see like this, be confident like this, without producing the characteristics of dharmas. Subhuti! What are said to be characteristics of dharmas, the Thus Come One says, are not characteristics of dharmas, they are called characteristics of dharmas.”

## CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO

“須菩提！若有人以滿無量阿僧祇世界七寶持用布施，若有善男子，善女人‚
發菩薩心者，持於此經，乃至四句偈等，受持讀誦，為人演說，其福勝彼.
云何為人演說？不取於相，如如不動. 何以故?”

“Subhuti! If someone fills immeasurable, *asamkhya* worlds with the seven treasures and uses it all to practice giving, and if there are virtuous men and women who develop the mind of a bodhisattva and take from this sutra, even just four lines of verse, retaining and reciting it, and expounding it to others, their merit surpasses that. How should you expound it to others? By not grasping at characteristics, being immovable like thusness. Why?”

一切有為法‚
如夢幻泡影‚
如露亦如電‚
應作如是觀.

All conditioned dharmas,
Like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows,
Like dew and like lightening,
Thus should they be perceived.

佛說是經已‚ 長老須菩提及諸比丘，比丘尼，優婆塞，優婆夷，一切世間天，人‚
阿修羅，聞佛所說，皆大歡喜，信受奉行.

After the Buddha had spoken this sutra, the Venerable Subhuti, with all the bhikṣus, bhikṣunis, upāsakas, upāsikās, and the heavenly beings, humans and asuras of all worldly realms heard what the Buddha had said and were all greatly pleased, confidently receiving and respectively practicing it.

## Chapter One - Introduction

如是我聞：

Thus have I heard:

一時，薄伽梵住最勝光曜七寶莊嚴，放大光明，普照一切無邊世界，無量方所妙飾間列，周圓無際，其量難測，超過三界所行之處，勝出世間善根所起，最極自在淨識為相。如來所都，諸大菩薩眾所雲集，無量天、龍、藥叉、健達縛、阿素洛、揭路茶、緊捺洛、牟呼洛伽、人、非人等，常所翼從，廣大法味喜樂所持，作諸眾生一切義利，滅諸煩惱災橫纏垢，遠離眾魔、過諸莊嚴，如來莊嚴之所依處，大念、慧、行以為遊路，大止妙觀以為所乘，大空、無相、無願解脫為所入門，無量功德眾所莊嚴，大寶花王眾所建立大宮殿中。

One time, the Bhagavān was abiding in an utterly radiant palace adorned with the seven treasures, emanating a great light that illuminated universally throughout infinite world-systems, immeasurable locations adorned by well-arranged marvels, their quantity difficult to calculate, transcending anything found in the Triple Realm. Having left the world by way of such awesome roots of goodness, a most extremely sovereign pure consciousness was the only characteristic. In such a domain of a Thus Come One, all the great bodhisattvas gathered together like clouds, immeasurable *devas*, *nagas*, *yaksas*, *gandharavas*, *asuras*, *garudas*, *kimnaras*, *mahoragas*, humans, nonhumans, and all other such ‘birds of the same feather’, the flavor of the broad, great Dharma sustaining their joy and delight, bringing about benefit for all sentient beings by putting an end to oppressive afflictions and restricting defilements, escaping the hordes of Mara, and surpassing all worldly adornments. Wherever there are such adornments of a Thus Come One, the practices of great Mindfulness (*smrti*) and Wisdom (*prajna*) are pathways. Great Stopping (*samatha*) and subtle Observation (*vipasyana*) are vehicles, and liberation by great Emptiness, Characteristiclessness, and Wishlessness are gateways, all adorned by immeasurable virtues, established by the gathering in the vast palace of the Great Jewel Flower King.

是薄伽梵最清淨覺，不二現行，趣無相法。住於佛住逮得一切佛平等性，到無障處，不可轉法，所行無礙，其所成立不可思議。遊於三世平等法性，其身流布一切世界，於一切法智無疑滯，於一切行成就大覺，於諸法智無有疑惑，凡所現身不可分別，一切菩薩正所求智，得佛無二住勝彼岸，不相間雜。如來解脫妙智究竟，證無中邊佛地平等，極於法界，盡虛空性窮未來際。

The Bhagavān, the supreme, pure Awakened One, practicing without manifesting duality, brought about the Characteristicless Dharma. Abiding in the Abode of Buddha, where the equal nature of all buddhas is realized, arriving where there are no hindrances, [where] the irreversible Dharma is practiced without obstruction, that which is inconceivable was established. Roaming throughout the equanimous dharmic nature of the Triple World with a body that saturates all worlds. By doubtless, unblocked knowledge of every *dharma*, by the perfect accomplishment of every practice, with undeluded, doubtless knowledge of all *dharmas* that manifests un-differentiate-able bodies, the knowledge bodhisattvas correctly seek, that victorious far shore of the Buddha’s nondual abode was attained without the mixing-up of characteristics. The subtle knowledge of the liberation of the Thus Come One having been fulfilled, the equality of all Buddha lands, being without middle or extremes, is realized, and the ultimate extent of the Dharmadhatu is reached, exhausting even the nature of space, never coming to an end.

與無量大聲聞眾俱，一切調順，皆是佛子，心善解脫，慧善解脫，戒善清淨，趣求法樂；多聞、聞持，其聞積集；善思所思，善說所說，善作所作；捷慧、速慧、利慧、出慧、勝決擇慧、大慧、廣慧、及無等慧，慧寶成就；具足三明，逮得第一現法樂住；大淨福田，威儀寂靜，無不圓滿；大忍柔和，成就無減，已善奉行如來聖教。

Also gathered was an immeasurable number of great Voice-Hearers, each one disciplined [subdued], all children of the Buddha, well liberated in mind, well liberated in wisdom, well purified in discipline, ever seeking Dharma Joy. Having heard much, having retained what they heard, their learning was well gathered. Their thoughts were good thoughts, their speech was good speech, and their actions were good actions. They were of swift wisdom, quick wisdom, beneficial wisdom, ‘far out’ wisdom, honorable wisdom, great wisdom, and equanimous wisdom, perfected wisdom jewels; endowed with the Three Knowledges [*trividyā* - **1. remembering former lives, 2. divine eye of the future, and 3. present knowing of the destruction of contaminants], and having arrived at the foremost state of abiding in Dharma Joy, they were great, pure fields of merit, perfect in their comportment, with nothing unfulfilled; their great patience (*ksanti*) and gentleness was complete and unceasing, having already revered and practiced the sagely teachings of the Thus Come One.

There were also immeasurable numbers of bodhisattva mahasattvas, having come from various Buddha lands. They all abided in the Great Vehicle, traveling [in] the Dharma of the Great Vehicle, their minds equanimous toward all sentient beings, free from discriminating and/or not discriminating the various kinds of discriminations, conquering all the enmity of hordes of Maras, going beyond the minds of all Voice Hearers and the Solitary Awakened, sustained by the joy of the flavor of the broad, great Dharma, transcending the Five Dreads, destined to enter the non-regressing stage, where the stressful stages of all sentient beings and all afflictions appearing before them are calmed.

## Chapter 2 - The Characteristic of the Truth of Ultimate Meaning

### PART ONE - Logical Questioner and Revealing the Secret Meaning

爾時，如理請問菩薩摩訶薩，即於佛前問解甚深義密意菩薩言：「最勝子！言一切法無二，一切法無二者，何等一切法？云何為無二？」

At that time, Vidhivatpariprcchaka (’Logical Questioner’) Bodhisattva mahasattva, standing before the Buddha, questioned Gambhirārthasamdhinirmocana (’Revealing the Secret Meaning’) Bodhisattva mahasattva saying, “Jinaputra (’Child of the Victor’)! When it is said all *dharmas* are nondual, what are ‘all *dharmas’* (*sarva-dharma*), and what is called nondual (*advaya*)?”

解甚深義密意菩薩告如理請問菩薩曰：「善男子！一切法者，略有二種：一者、有為；二者、無為。是中有為，非有為非無為；無為，亦非無為非有為。」

Gambhirārthasamdhinirmocana Bodhisattva replied to Vidhivatpariprcchaka Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! ‘In general, all *dharmas’* are of two kinds: 1, conditioned (*saṃskṛta*) and 2, unconditioned (*asaṃskṛta*). Within this, **the conditioned is neither conditioned nor unconditioned; and the unconditioned is also neither unconditioned nor conditioned.

如理請問菩薩復問解甚深義密意菩薩言：「最勝子！如何有為，非有為非無為；無為，亦非無為非有為？」

Vidhivatpariprcchaka Bodhisattva further questioned Gambhirārthasamdhinirmocana Bodhisattva mahasattva saying, “Jinaputra! How is it that the conditioned is neither conditioned nor unconditioned, and the unconditioned, too, is neither unconditioned nor conditioned?”

解甚深義密意菩薩謂如理請問菩薩曰：「善男子！言有為者，乃是本師假施設句。若是本師假施設句，即是遍計所集、言辭所說；若是遍計所集、言辭所說，即是究竟種種遍計言辭所說。不成實故，非是有為。善男子！言無為者，亦墮言辭。設離有為、無為少有所說，其相亦爾。然非無事而有所說。何等為事？謂諸聖者以聖智、聖見，離名言故，現等正覺；即於如是離言法性，為欲令他現等覺故，假立名想謂之有為。

Gambhirārthasamdhinirmocana Bodhisattva said to Vidhivatpariprcchaka Bodhisattva, “Kulaputra! When ‘the conditioned’ is spoken of, this is just a conventional term employed by the Original Teacher. Since this is just a conventional term employed by the Original Teacher, it is just an accumulation of mental fabrications (*parikalpa*), some word that was said. Since this is just an accumulation of mental fabrications, some word that was said, then it is ultimately just all kinds of accumulations of mental fabrications of words that are said. Because it is completely not real, then it is unconditioned. Kulaputra! When ‘the unconditioned’ is spoken of, this is also just a conventional term. Even if something were said to be beyond the conditioned and unconditioned, it too would be characterized as such [i.e. as just a conventional term]. That does not mean, however, that there’s nothing going on [非無事]. What’s going on [為事]? What is known as the wisdom of all sages, the vision of sages, is beyond names and speech, and manifests as correct enlightenment. The nature of the Dharma is also like this, beyond speech. It is because they desire for others to manifest correct enlightenment that they employ names to perceive what is known as the conditioned.”

「善男子！言無為者，亦是本師假施設句；若是本師假施設句，即是遍計所集、言辭所說；若是遍計所集、言辭所說，即是究竟種種遍計言辭所說。不成實故，非是無為。善男子！言有為者，亦墮言辭。設離無為、有為少有所說，其相亦爾。然非無事而有所說。何等為事？謂諸聖者以聖智、聖見，離名言故，現等正覺；即於如是離言法性，為欲令他現等覺故，假立名想謂之無為。」

 “Kulaputra! When ‘the unconditioned’ is spoken of, this is also just a conventional term employed by the Original Teacher. Since this is just a conventional term employed by the Original Teacher, it is just an accumulation of mental fabrications (*parikalpa*), some word that was said. Since this is just an accumulation of mental fabrications, some word that was said, then it is ultimately just all kinds of accumulations of mental fabrications of words that are said. Because it is completely not real, then it is unconditioned. Kulaputra! When ‘the conditioned’ is spoken of, this is also just a conventional term. Even if something were said to be beyond the unconditioned and the conditioned, it would also be characterized as such [i.e. as just a conventional term]. That does not mean, however, that there’s nothing going on. What’s going on? What is known as the wisdom of all sages, the vision of sages, is beyond names and speech, manifest as correct enlightenment. The nature of the Dharma also being beyond speech like this, it is because they desire for others to manifest correct enlightenment that they employ names to perceive what is known as the unconditioned.”

爾時，如理請問菩薩摩訶薩復問解甚深義密意菩薩摩訶薩言：「最勝子！如何此事彼諸聖者以聖智、聖見，離名言故，現等正覺；即於如是離言法性，為欲令他現等覺故，假立名想，或謂有為？或謂無為？」

Then, Vidhivatpariprcchaka Bodhisattva further questioned Gambhirārthasamdhinirmocana Bodhisattva saying, “Jinaputra! Why do the wise, of wise vision, being beyond names and speech, manifesting correct enlightenment, and the nature of the Dharma also being beyond speech like this, desiring for others to manifest correct enlightenment, employ names to perceive what are called the conditioned and the unconditioned?”

解甚深義密意菩薩謂如理請問菩薩曰：「善男子！如善幻師或彼弟子，住四衢道，積集瓦、礫、草、葉、木等，現作種種幻化事業。所謂：象身、馬身、車身、步身，末尼、真珠、琉璃、螺貝、璧玉、珊瑚，種種財、穀、庫藏等身。若諸眾生愚癡、頑鈍、惡慧種類，無所曉知，於瓦、礫、草、葉、木等上諸幻化事，見已聞已，作如是念：『此所見者，實有象身、實有馬身、車身、步身，末尼、真珠、琉璃、螺貝、璧玉、珊瑚，種種財、穀、庫藏等身。』如其所見，如其所聞，堅固執著，隨起言說：『唯此諦實，餘皆愚妄。』彼於後時應更觀察。」

Gambhirārthasamdhinirmocana Bodhisattva said to Vidhivatpariprcchaka Bodhisattva, “Kulaputra! It’s like a skilled magician with an assistant who gathers together tiles, shards, grass, leaves, and wood at the intersection of four paths and who creates all kinds of illusory things [’goings ons’ 事業] such as: the bodies of elephants, horses, carts, soldiers, maṇi jewels, true pearls, lapis lazuli, conch shells, precious jade, rare coral, and all kinds of various goods, grain, veritable treasuries of such things. All ignorant, dull witted sentient beings, the kinds with bad intellect, without the slightest bit of knowledge, when they see and hear of these illusory things made of tiles, shards, grass, leaves, and wood they think, ‘This, what I am seeing, is really an elephant, really a horse, cart, soldiers, maṇi jewels, true pearls, lapis lazuli, conch shells, precious jade, rare coral, and all kinds of various goods, grain, veritable treasuries of such things.’ Thus, they steadfastly cling to what they see and what they hear of, and go on to say, ‘Only this is real, everything else is delusion.’ Afterward they need to observe things more carefully.”

「若有眾生非愚、非鈍、善慧種類，有所曉知，於瓦、礫、草、葉、木等上諸幻化事，見已聞已，作如是念：『此所見者，無實象身、無實馬身、車身、步身，末尼、真珠、琉璃、螺貝、璧玉、珊瑚，種種財、穀、庫藏等身；然有幻狀迷惑眼事。於中發起大象身想，或大象身差別之想，乃至發起種種財、穀、庫藏等想，或彼種類差別之想。』不如所見，不如所聞，堅固執著，隨起言說：『唯此諦實，餘皆愚妄。』為欲表知如是義故，亦於此中隨起言說。彼於後時不須觀察。」

Those sentient beings that are not ignorant, not dull, the kind with good intellect, that have some knowledge. When they see or hear of these illusory things made of tiles, shards, grass, leaves, and wood they think, ‘This, what I am seeing, is not really an elephant, not really a horse, cart, soldiers, maṇi jewels, true pearls, lapis lazuli, conch shells, precious jade, rare coral, and all kinds of various goods, grain, veritable treasuries of such things. These are just illusions of a magician deceiving the eye, bringing about the arising of the perceiving of a large elephant, or the differentiated perception of a large elephant, as well as the arising of the perception of all kinds of goods, grain, veritable treasuries, or the differentiated perception of all of those kinds of things.’ They do not steadfastly cling to things as they appear or how they have heard [spoken about], and they go on to say, ‘Only this is real [i.e. that elephants are ‘illusory’ and not real], everything else is delusion.’ But they only go on to say this with the desire for [others] to understand meaning as such. Afterward they do not need to observe things more carefully.”

「如是，若有眾生是愚夫類，是異生類，未得諸聖出世間慧，於一切法離言法性不能了知；彼於一切有為、無為，見已聞已，作如是念：『此所得者，決定實有有為、無為。』如其所見，如其所聞，堅固執著，隨起言說：『唯此諦實，餘皆癡妄。』彼於後時應更觀察。

Like this, there are sentient beings that are ignorant simpleton types, the common types, not yet having attained the transcendent wisdom of all sages, unable to comprehend the nature of all dharmas that is beyond speech. When they see and hear about the conditioned and unconditioned they think, ‘This, what I have attained, is most certainly really the conditioned and the unconditioned.’ Thus, they steadfastly cling to what they see and what they hear of, and go on to say, ‘Only this is real, everything else is delusion.’ Afterward they need to observe things more carefully.

「若有眾生非愚夫類，已見聖諦，已得諸聖出世間慧，於一切法離言法性如實了知；彼於一切有為、無為，見已聞已，作如是念：『此所得者，決定無實有為、無為。然有分別所起行相，猶如幻事迷惑覺慧，於中發起為、無為想，或為、無為差別之想。』不如所見，不如所聞，堅固執著，隨起言說：『唯此諦實，餘皆癡妄。』為欲表知如是義故，亦於此中隨起言說。彼於後時不須觀察。

Those sentient beings that are not ignorant simpleton types, who have seen the Truth of the sages, who have attained the transcendent knowledge of all sages, who have comprehended the nature of all dharmas that is beyond speech. When they see and hear about the conditioned and unconditioned they think, ‘This, what I have attained, is most certainly *not* really the conditioned and the unconditioned. Rather they are differentiations arising from conditioned characteristics, just like the illusory [magical] effects [goings ons 事] from imagination are confused understandings in which one gives rise to ideas about the conditioned and the unconditioned, and ideas about whether they exist or not.’ They do not steadfastly cling to things just as they appear, or how they have heard [spoken about], and they go on to say, ‘Only *this* is real, everything else is delusion.’ But they only go on to say this with the desire for [others] to understand meaning as such. Afterward they do not need to observe things more carefully.”

「如是，善男子！彼諸聖者於此事中，以聖智、聖見，離名言故，現等正覺；即於如是離言法性，為欲令他現等覺故，假立名想，謂之有為，謂之無為。」

Thus, Kulaputra! All sages, in the midst of things [goings ons 事] like this, realize correct enlightenment with sagely knowledge and sagely vision that is beyond speech. The nature of the Dharma also being beyond speech like this, desiring for others to manifest correct enlightenment, they employ names to perceive what are called the conditioned and the unconditioned?”

爾時，解甚深義密意菩薩，欲重宣此義而說頌曰：

Then, Gambhirārthasamdhinirmocana Bodhisattva, wishing to emphasize the meaning of this said in verse:

佛說離言無二義，　　
甚深非愚之所行；　
愚夫於此癡所惑，　　
樂著二依言戲論。

The Buddha has explained, beyond speech, the meaning of nonduality,
Extremely profound, not the way of the ignorant.
The ignorant, in their deluded confusion
Delight in clinging to duality, relying on verbal fabrications and debate.

彼或不定或邪定，　　
流轉極長生死苦；　
復違如是正智論，　　
當生牛羊等類中。

They are either without certainty or perverse [in understanding],
Flowing along in the suffering of birth and death for a long time;
They go against the discourses on correct wisdom and
will certainly be reborn as cows, sheep, and so forth.

### PART TWO - Born of the Dharma

爾時，法涌菩薩白佛言：「世尊！從此東方過七十二殑伽河沙等世界，有世界，名具大名稱；是中如來，號廣大名稱。我於先日，從彼佛土發來至此。我於彼佛土曾見一處，有七萬七千外道并其師首，同一會坐。為思諸法勝義諦相，彼共思議、稱量、觀察、遍推求時，於一切法勝義諦相，竟不能得。唯除種種意解，別異意解，變異意解，互相違背共興諍論，口出矛[矛*(替-曰+貝)]，更相[矛*(替-曰+貝)]已、刺已、惱已、壞已，各各離散。世尊！我於爾時，竊作是念：『如來出世，甚奇！希有！由出世故，乃於如是超過一切尋思所行勝義諦相，亦有通達，作證可得。』」說是語已。

At that time, Dharmodgata Bodhisattva (’Born of the ‘Dharma’) said to the Buddha: “World-honored One! East of here, past as many worlds as grains of sand in seventy-two Ganges Rivers, there is a world-system named Viśālakīrti (’Renowned’). The Tathāgata there is named Mahaviśālakīrti Tathāgata (’Great Renown’). I used to live there before I came here. In that Buddha Land I once saw seventy-seven thousand heretics all seated with their teachers gathered together in one place. Regarding the characteristic of the ultimate meaning of all things (*sarva-dharma-paramārtha-satya-lakṣana* 諸法勝義諦相), they thought, pondered, investigated, and thoroughly examined, but in the end they were unable to reach any conclusion about the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning of all things. They went no further than to exclude certain interpretations, delineate other interpretations, and modify their own interpretations. They confronted one another and argued fiercely. Their mouths emitted barbed comments, pointed, angry and vicious. Then each went a separate way. World-Honored One! At that time I thought to myself, ‘The appearance of a Tathāgata in the world is indeed most rare! Rare indeed! Only because of this appearance does it become possible to attain ‘realization’ (*sākṣāt-karoti*) of the characteristic of truth of ultimate meaning, which goes beyond (transcends, *samatikram*) the sphere of any reasoning (*vitarka*).’ This is what I said to myself.

爾時，世尊告法涌菩薩曰：「善男子！如是，如是！如汝所說。我於超過一切尋思勝義諦相，現等正覺；現等覺已，為他宣說、顯現、開解、施設、照了。何以故？我說：『勝義是諸聖者內自所證；尋思所行是諸異生展轉所證。』是故，法涌！由此道理，當知勝義超過一切尋思境相。復次，法涌！我說：『勝義無相所行；尋思但行有相境界。』是故，法涌！由此道理，當知勝義超過一切尋思境相。復次，法涌！我說：『勝義不可言說，尋思但行言說境界。』是故，法涌！由此道理，當知勝義超過一切尋思境相。復次，法涌！我說：『勝義絕諸表示，尋思但行表示境界。』是故，法涌！由此道理，當知勝義超過一切尋思境相。復次，法涌！我說：『勝義絕諸諍論，尋思但行諍論境界。』是故，法涌！由此道理，當知勝義超過一切尋思境相。

At that time, the World-honored One addressed the Dharmodgata Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! So it is! So it is! Just as you have explained. I manifest correct enlightenment, which goes beyond all reasoning about the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning. Being already correctly enlightened, I proclaim, reveal, expound upon, share, and illumine for others. Why? I [have] said, ‘The ultimate meaning is something all sages internally ‘self-realize’, while reasoning is something ‘realized’ by the give and take of common people.’ For this reason, Dharmodgata! By way of this logic, you should know that the ultimate meaning goes beyond all the constructions of characteristics of reasoning (*sarva* *vitarka viṣaya lakṣaṇa*).

“Furthermore, Dharmodgata! I [have] said, ‘The ultimate meaning is something that functions without characteristics. Reasoning only functions with constructions (*viṣaya*) having characteristics.’ For this reason, Dharmodgata! By way of this logic, you should know that the ultimate meaning goes beyond all constructed realms of characteristics.”

“Furthermore, Dharmodgata! I [have] said, ‘The ultimate meaning cannot be spoken about. Reasoning can only be done within the constructs of language.’ For this reason, Dharmodgata! By way of this logic, you should know that the ultimate meaning goes beyond all constructed realms of characteristics.”

“Furthermore, Dharmodgata! I [have] said, ‘The ultimate meaning severs all indication. Reasoning is only done within the constructs of indication.’ By way of this logic, you should know that the ultimate meaning goes beyond all the constructions of characteristics of reasoning.”

“Furthermore, Dharmodgata! I [have] said, ‘The ultimate meaning severs all disputation. Reasoning is only done within the constructs of dispute.’ By way of this logic,  you should know that the ultimate meaning goes beyond all the constructions of characteristics of reasoning.”

「法涌！當知，譬如有人盡其壽量習辛苦味；於蜜、石蜜上妙美味，不能尋思、不能比度、不能信解。或於長夜由欲貪勝解諸欲熾火所燒然故；於內除滅一切色、聲、香、味、觸相妙遠離樂，不能尋思、不能比度、不能信解。或於長夜由言說勝解，樂著世間綺言說故；於內寂靜聖默然樂，不能尋思、不能比度、不能信解。或於長夜由見聞覺知表示勝解，樂著世間諸表示故；於永除斷一切表示薩迦耶滅究竟涅槃，不能尋思、不能比度、不能信解。法涌！當知，譬如有人於其長夜由有種種我所、攝受，諍論勝解，樂著世間諸諍論故；於北拘盧洲無我所、無攝受、離諍論，不能尋思、不能比度、不能信解。如是，法涌！諸尋思者，於超一切尋思所行勝義諦相，不能尋思、不能比度、不能信解。」

“Dharmodgata! You should know, it’s like someone who has been accustomed to tart and bitter flavors their entire life. They would be incapable of understanding (‘reasoning’), evaluating, or believing in the wonderful flavor of honey or rock candy.”

“Or [someone who], during the ‘long night’ [of ignorance] has only had an overwhelming desire for sensual cravings, a desire that burns like fire. They would be incapable of understanding, evaluating, or believing in the wonderful joy of liberation that comes from the inner cessation of all the characteristics of forms, sounds, scents, flavors, feelings, and thoughts.”

“Or, during the ‘long night’, they cling to rhetoric and speech because of an overwhelming interest in words and talking. They would be incapable of understanding, evaluating, or believing in the joy and inner tranquility of sagely silence.”

“Or, during the ‘long night’, they are only concerned with and take delight in all the worldly explanations they hear, express and understand. They would be incapable of understanding, evaluating, or even believing in the final *nirvana* (cessation) that forever cuts off and eradicates personality (*satkāya*).”

“Dharmodgata! You should know, it’s like someone who, during their ‘long night’, has only had all kinds of ‘self-based’ possessions, attachments, arguments, and interests (*adhimokṣa*). Being attached to and delighting in worldly argumentation, they would be incapable of understanding, evaluating, or believing that in Uttarakuru [the northern continent] they are without self and possesions, free of argumentation.”

“Thus, Dharmodgata! All reasoning, is entirely incapable of understanding, evaluating, or believing the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning.”

爾時，世尊欲重宣此義，而說頌曰：

Then, the World Honored One, to emphasize the meaning of this, said in verse:

內證無相之所行，　　
不可言說絕表示，　
息諸諍論勝義諦，　　
超過一切尋思相。」

The characteristicless practice self-realized internally
Is ineffable, beyond explanation,
It is the truth of ultimate meaning that ends all dispute
And transcends all the characteristics of reasoning.

### PART THREE - Well Purified Intellect

爾時，善清淨慧菩薩白佛言：「世尊！甚奇！乃至世尊！善說！如世尊言：『勝義諦相微細甚深，超過諸法一異性相，難可通達。』世尊！我即於此曾見一處，有眾菩薩等正修行勝解行地，同一會坐，皆共思議勝義諦相與諸行相一異性相。於此會中，一類菩薩作如是言：『勝義諦相與諸行相都無有異。』一類菩薩復作是言：『非勝義諦相與諸行相都無有異；然勝義諦相諸行相。』有餘菩薩疑惑猶豫，復作是言：『是諸菩薩，誰言諦實？誰言虛妄？誰如理行？誰不如理？』或唱是言：『勝義諦相與諸行相都無有異。』或唱是言：『勝義諦相異諸行相。』世尊！我見彼已竊作是念：『此諸善男子愚癡、頑鈍、不明、不善、不如理行，於勝義諦微細甚深，超過諸行一異性相，不能解了。』」說是語已。

Then, Suvisuddhimati Bodhisattva Mahasattva (’Well Purified Intellect’) addressed the Buddha saying, “World Honored One!  So wonderful! Most world-honored one! Well said! Just as the World-Honored One says: ‘The characteristic of truth of ultimate meaning is extremely profound, going beyond the characteristics of all things (*dharmas*) having a ‘singularized’ or differentiated nature, difficult to perceive.”

“World Honored One! I once saw this place where there was a group of bodhisattvas cultivating the correct practices of the Stage of Liberation (9th *bhumi*; *adhivimokṣa*). Seated together, they were all thinking about whether the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning (*paramārtha-satya-lakṣana*) and all the characteristics of conditional thought formations (*saṃskāra-lakṣaṇa*) were alike or dissimilar [in terms of the] characteristic of their nature. Among those assembled, one group of bodhisattvas said something like, ‘There is no difference between the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning and all the characteristics of *saṃskāra*.’ Another group said, ‘It is not the case that there is no difference between the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning and all the characteristics of *saṃskāra*. There is [a difference between] the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning and all the characteristics of *saṃskāra*.’ There were other bodhisattvas who were in doubt and uncertain. They said, ‘Of these bodhisattvas, who is speaking the truth? Who is speaking falsely? Who is being logical? Who is not being logical?’  Some cried out saying, ‘There is no difference between the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning and all the characteristics of *saṃskāra*.’ Others cried out saying, ‘The characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning is different from all the characteristics of *saṃskāra.’”*

“World Honored One! When I saw that, I thought to myself, ‘All these ‘good’ (virtuous) sons are ignorant, confused, stupid, dull, unenlightened, not ‘good’ (virtuous), not being logical, unable to understand that the truth of ultimate meaning is subtle, extremely profound, going beyond all conditionings’ (*saṃskāra*) characteristic of having a ‘singularized’ or differentiated nature.”

爾時，世尊告善清淨慧菩薩曰：「善男子！如是，如是。如汝所說：『彼諸善男子愚癡、頑鈍、不明、不善、不如理行，於勝義諦微細甚深，超過諸行一異性相，不能解了。』何以故？善清淨慧！非於諸行如是行時，名能通達勝義諦相，或於勝義諦而得作證。何以故？善清淨慧！若勝義諦相與諸行相都無異者：應於今時一切異生皆已見諦；又諸異生皆應已得無上方便安隱涅槃；或應已證阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。若勝義諦相與諸行相一向異者：已見諦者於諸行相應不除遣；若不除遣諸行相者，應於相縛不得解脫；此見諦者於諸相縛不解脫故，於麁重縛亦應不脫；由於二縛不解脫故，已見諦者應不能得無上方便安隱涅槃；或不應證阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。

Then, the World Honored One told Suvisuddhimati Bodhisattva, “Kulaputra! So it is. So it is. Just as you have said, ‘All those kulaputra are ignorant, confused, stupid, dull, unenlightened, not ‘good’ (virtuous), not being logical, unable to understand that the truth of ultimate meaning is subtle, extremely profound, going beyond the characteristic of all conditionings (*saṃskāra*) of having a similar or differentiated nature. For what reason?”

“Suvisuddhimati! One is unable to perceive the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning or realize the truth of ultimate meaning when one practices (conditions) as they are practicing (conditioning) with names. For what reason?”

“Suvisuddhimati! If it was the case that the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning and all the characteristics of *saṃskāra* were not different, then right now every different kind of being would all already see the Truth. They would also all have already attained the highest, most skillful, tranquil nirvana, and they all would also have realized *anuttara-samyak-sambodhi*. If it was the case that the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning and all the characteristics of *saṃskāra* were totally different then one who has seen the Truth would not have removed the bondage (*bandha*) of all the characteristics of *saṃskāra*. If one hasn’t removed all the characteristics of *saṃskāra*, one does not attain liberation from the bondage of characteristics. This person who has seen the Truth, but hasn’t been liberated from the bondage of all characteristics, is then also not free from the bondage of ‘gross, coarse heaviness’ (*sthūla?*). Since they are not liberated from those two bondages [*sthūla* and *lakṣaṇa*], this person who has seen the truth is unable to attain the highest, most skillful, tranquil nirvana, and they also would not realize *anuttara-samyak-sambodhi*.”     **

「善清淨慧！由於今時非諸異生皆已見諦；非諸異生已能獲得無上方便安隱涅槃；亦非已證阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。是故勝義諦相與諸行相都無異相，不應道理！若於此中作如是言：『勝義諦相與諸行相都無異者。』由此道理，當知一切非如理行，不如正理。

“Suvisuddhimati! It is not the case that right now every different kind of being has all already seen the truth. It is not the case that all the different beings can proclaim that they have attained the highest, most skillful, tranquil nirvana, or that they have realized *anuttara-samyak-sambodhi*. For this reason, [to say that] the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning and all the characteristics of *saṃskāra* are not different is not logical. If, from this, you were to say, ‘The characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning and all the characteristics of *saṃskāra* are not different,’ you should know, this rationale it is totally not being logical, not correct logic.”

「善清淨慧！由於今時非見諦者於諸行相不能除遣，然能除遣；非見諦者於諸相縛不能解脫，然能解脫；非見諦者於麁重縛不能解脫，然能解脫；以於二障能解脫故，亦能獲得無上方便安隱涅槃；或有能證阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。是故勝義諦相與諸行相，一向異相，不應道理！若於此中作如是言：『勝義諦相與諸行相一向異者。』由此道理，當知一切非如理行，不如正理。

“Suvisuddhimati! Neither is it the case that right now those who see the Truth have not been able to remove all the characteristics of *saṃskāra*, **for they *have* been **able to remove them. Nor is it the case that those who see the Truth have not been able to be liberated from the bondage of all characteristics, for they *have* been able to be liberated. Nor is it the case that those who see the truth have been unable to be liberated from the bondage of ‘gross heaviness’, for they have been able to be liberated. It is precisely because they have been able to be liberated from these two obstructions that they are also able to proclaim to have attained the highest, most skillful, tranquil nirvana, or that they have been able to realize *anuttara-samyak-sambodhi*. For this reason, [the assertions that] the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning and all the characteristics of *saṃskāra* are the same *or* that they are different in characteristic is not the way of logic! If, from this, you were to say, ‘the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning and all the characteristics of *saṃskāra* are the same *or* that they are different,’ you should know, this rationale it is totally not being logical, not correct logic.”

「復次，善清淨慧！若勝義諦相與諸行相都無異者，如諸行相墮雜染相，此勝義諦相亦應如是墮雜染相。善清淨慧！若勝義諦相與諸行相一向異者，應非一切行相共相，名勝義諦相。善清淨慧！由於今時勝義諦相非墮雜染相；諸行共相名勝義諦相。是故勝義諦相與諸行相都無異相，不應道理；勝義諦相與諸行相一向異相，不應道理！若於此中作如是言：『勝義諦相與諸行相都無有異；或勝義諦相與諸行相一向異者。』由此道理，當知一切非如理行，不如正理。

“Furthermore, Suvisuddhimati! If the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning and all the characteristics of *saṃskāra* were not different, then, just as all the characteristics of *saṃskāra* are characterized as ‘falling’ (*prāyaścitta?*) into corruption (*kaṣāya*), then this characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning should also be falling into corruption. Suvisuddhimati! If the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning and all the characteristics of *saṃskāra* were totally different, then the common characteristic (*sāmānya*-*lakṣaṇa*) of every characteristic of *saṃskāra* wouldn’t be called the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning. Suvisuddhimati! Since, right now, the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning is not characterized as falling into corruption, the common characteristic of all *saṃskāra* is called the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning. For this reason, [the assertion that] the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning and all the characteristics of *saṃskāra* are not different is not logical; and [the assertion that] the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning and all the characteristics of *saṃskāra* are totally different is not logical! If, from this, you were to say, ‘The characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning and all the characteristics of *saṃskāra* were not different *or* that the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning and all the characteristics of *saṃskāra* are totally different,’ you should know, this rationale  is totally not being logical, not correct logic.”

「復次，善清淨慧！若勝義諦相與諸行相都無異者，如勝義諦相於諸行相無有差別，一切行相亦應如是無有差別。修觀行者於諸行中，如其所見、如其所聞、如其所覺、如其所知，不應後時更求勝義。若勝義諦相與諸行相一向異者，應非諸行唯無我性、唯無自性之所顯現，是勝義相。又應俱時別相成立，謂雜染相及清淨相。

“Furthermore, Suvisuddhimati! If the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning and all the characteristics of *saṃskāra* were not different, then just as the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning and all the characteristics of *saṃskāra* are without differentiation, every characteristic of *saṃskāra* should then also be without differentiation like this. And one who cultivates awareness from within all *saṃskāra* would not need to further search for ultimate truth in what they have seen, what they have heard, what they are aware of and what they know, until a later time. If it was the case that the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning and all the characteristics of *saṃskāra* were totally different, then it would not be that all *saṃskāra* are merely selflessness in nature, and that that which manifests (appears) merely without self nature is the characteristic of ultimate meaning. But then, the characteristic of ultimate meaning would be being differentiated as both ‘corrupt’ (*kaṣāya*) and also ‘pure’ (*vissudhi*).”

「善清淨慧！由於今時一切行相皆有差別，非無差別；修觀行者於諸行中，如其所見、如其所聞、如其所覺、如其所知，復於後時更求勝義。又即諸行唯無我性、唯無自性之所顯現，名勝義相。又非俱時染淨二相別相成立。是故勝義諦相與諸行相都無有異、或一向異，不應道理！若於此中作如是言：『勝義諦相與諸行相都無有異、或一向異者。』由此道理，當知一切非如理行，不如正理。

“Suviduddhimati! Right now each of the characteristics of *saṃskāra* are differentiated. It is not that they are undifferentiated. One who cultivates awareness from within all *saṃskāra* does further search for ultimate truth in what they have seen, what they have heard, what they are aware of, and what they know, until a later time. Furthermore, all *saṃskāra* are merely selfless (*anātman*) in nature, and that which manifests merely without inherent self-nature (*niḥsvabhāva*) is called the characteristic of ultimate meaning. And it is not that the two characteristics ‘corruption’ and ‘purity’ are simultaneously being used to establish each other. For this reason, [the assertion that] the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning and all the characteristics of *saṃskāra* are without any difference or that they are totally different is not logical! If, from this, you were to say, ‘The characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning and all the characteristics of *saṃskāra* are without any difference *or* that they are totally different,’ you should know, this rationale it is totally not being logical, not correct logic.”

「善清淨慧！如螺貝上鮮白色性，不易施設與彼螺貝一相異相。如螺貝上鮮白色性；金上黃色亦復如是。如箜篌聲上美妙曲性，不易施設與箜篌聲一相異相。如黑沈上有妙香性，不易施設與彼黑沈一相異相。如胡椒上辛猛利性，不易施設與彼胡椒一相異相。如胡椒上辛猛利性，訶梨淡性亦復如是。如蠧羅綿上有柔軟性，不易施設與蠧羅綿一相異相。如熟酥上所有醍醐，不易施設與彼熟酥一相異相。又如一切行上無常性，一切有漏法上苦性，一切法上補特伽羅無我性，不易施設與彼行等一相異相。又如貪上不寂靜相及雜染相，不易施設此與彼貪一相異相。如於貪上，於瞋、癡上，當知亦爾。如是，善清淨慧！勝義諦相不可施設與諸行相一相異相。

“Suviduddhimati! It is like the fresh white color coming from a conch shell, it is not easily defined as being the same in characteristic or different in characteristic from the conch shell. Like the nature of the fresh white color of a conch shell, the gold color coming from gold is also like this. Like the nature of the sound of beautiful melodies coming from a lute, they are not easily defined as being the same in characteristic or different in characteristic from the lute. Like the nature of a subtle fragrance coming from incense, it is not easily defined as being the same in characteristic or different in characteristic from the incense. Like the bitter taste coming from pepper, it is not easily defined as being the same in characteristic or different in characteristic from pepper, or the nature of the taste coming from a pungent nut is also like this. Like the softness coming from silk, it is not easily defined as being the same in characteristic or different in characteristic from the silk. Like cream coming from milk, it is not easily defined as being the same in characteristic or different in characteristic from the milk. So too, like the nature of all *saṃskāra* coming from impermanence, the nature of all outflowing *dharmas* coming from suffering, the nature of all *dharmas* coming from a selfless *pudgala,* they are not easily defined as being the same in characteristic or different in characteristic from those corresponding *saṃskāra*. So too, like the characteristics of restlessness (inquietude) and moral affliction (*saṃkleśa*) coming from attraction (*rāga*), it is not easily defined as being the same in characteristic or different in characteristic from attraction. Like that which comes from attraction, you should know, that which comes from aversion and confusion is also so. Like this, Suviduddhimati! The characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning is not easily defined as being the same in characteristic or different in characteristic from the characteristics of *saṃskāra*.”

「善清淨慧！我於如是微細、極微細，甚深、極甚深，難通達、極難通達，超過諸法一異性相，勝義諦相現正等覺；現等覺已為他宣說、顯示、開解、施設、照了。」

“Suviduddhimati! I realize correct, equanimous awakening to the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning which is subtle, extremely subtle, profound, extremely profound, difficult to penetrate, extremely difficult to penetrate, going beyond the nature of similitude or difference of all *dharmas*, and having realized equanimous awakening, I explain it to others, reveal it, ‘open it up’, define it, and illuminate it.”

爾時，世尊欲重宣此義，而說頌曰：

At that time, the World Honored One, wanting to emphasis this meaning, spoke in verse saying:

行界勝義相，　　
離一異性相；　
若分別一異，　　
彼非如理行。

The characteristics of the realm of *saṃskāra* and that of ultimate truth
Go beyond the characteristics of having the nature of similitude or difference.
If one differentiates [things as] one or different
That is not acting (practicing, or conditioning) logically.

眾生為相縛，　　
及彼麁重縛；　
要勤修止觀，　　
爾乃得解脫。」

Sentient beings are bound by characteristics
And they are bound by ‘gross heaviness’ (*sthūla*).
It is important to practice with drive (*vīrya*) **‘stopping’ and ‘observing’ (*śamatha* and *vipaśyanā*)
So as to attain liberation (*vimokṣa*).

### PART FOUR - Subhūti

爾時，世尊告長老善現曰：「善現！汝於有情界中，知幾有情懷增上慢，為增上慢所執持故記別所解？汝於有情界中，知幾有情離增上慢記別所解？」

At that time, the World Honored One said to the elder Subhūti, “Subhūti! How many people do you know in the world that express their understanding (or liberation) with pride (or conceit) and how many people do you know in the world that express their understanding without pride?”

長老善現白佛言：「世尊！我知有情界中少分有情離增上慢記別所解。世尊！我知有情界中有無量無數不可說有情懷增上慢，為增上慢所執持故記別所解。

The elder Subhūti replied to the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! I know very few people in the world who express their understanding without pride. World-Honored One! I know immeasurable numbers of sentient beings who are prideful and express their understanding with pride.”

「世尊！我於一時住阿練若大樹林中，時有眾多苾芻亦於此林依近我住。我見彼諸苾芻於日後分，展轉聚集，依有所得現觀，各說種種相法，記別所解。

“World-Honored One! I was once abiding in an *āraṇya* within a large forest. At that time, there were also many *bhikṣus* dwelling nearby. I saw all those *bhikṣus* gather together one morning after sunrise and, based upon the insight(s) each had attained, they explained the various characteristics of the Dharma according to their understanding.”    **

「於中一類，由得蘊故、得蘊相故、得蘊起故、得蘊盡故、得蘊滅故、得蘊滅作證故，記別所解。如此一類由得蘊故，復有一類由得處故，復有一類得緣起故，當知亦爾。

Among one type, their understanding was because of only attaining [knowledge of] the aggregates, attaining [knowledge of] the characteristics of the aggregates, attaining [knowledge of] the arising of the aggregates, attaining [knowledge of] the disintegration of the aggregates, attaining [knowledge of] the cessation of the aggregates, and attaining realization of the cessation of the aggregates. Just as this type only attained [knowledge of] the aggregates, there was another type that attained [knowledge of] the bases (*āyatana*), while another type attained [knowledge of] dependent origination in the same way.”

「復有一類由得食故、得食相故、得食起故、得食盡故、得食滅故、得食滅作證故，記別所解。

“There was another type whose understanding was because of only attaining knowledge of [four kinds of] sustenance (*āhāra*: food, contact, continuity, and consciousness), attaining [knowledge of] the characteristics of sustenance, attaining [knowledge of] the disintegration of sustenance, attaining [knowledge of] the cessation of sustenance, and attaining realization of the cessation of sustenance.”

「復有一類由得諦故、得諦相故、得諦遍知故、得諦永斷故、得諦作證故、得諦修習故，記別所解。

“There was another type whose understanding was because of only attaining [knowledge of] the [Four Noble] Truth(s), attaining [knowledge of] the characteristics of the Truth(s), attaining full knowledge of the Truth(s), attaining realization of the Truth(s), and attaining complete cultivation of the Truth(s).”

「復有一類由得界故、得界相故、得界種種性故、得界非一性故、得界滅故、得界滅作證故，記別所解。

There was another type whose understanding was because of only attaining knowledge of realms, attaining [knowledge of] the characteristics of realms, attaining [knowledge of] the various natures of realms, attaining [knowledge of] the non-unity of realms, attaining [knowledge of] the cessation of realms, and attaining realization of the cessation of realms.”

「復有一類由得念住故、得念住相故、得念住能治所治故、得念住修故、得念住未生令生故、得念住生已堅住不忘倍修增廣故，記別所解。如有一類得念住故；復有一類得正斷故；得神足故；得諸根故；得諸力故；得覺支故，當知亦爾。

There was another type whose understanding was because of only attaining [knowledge of] [the Four] Foundations of mindfulness, attaining [knowledge of] the characteristics of Foundations of Mindfulness, attaining [knowledge of] the states controlled by the Foundations of Mindfulness, attaining, attaining [knowledge of] the cultivation of the Foundations of Mindfulness, attaining [knowledge of] their arising from a state of being non-arisen, and attaining [knowledge of] their assured non-forgetfulness after arising, and the increasing of mindfulness from repeated practice. Just as there were those whose understanding was only because of attaining [knowledge of] the Foundations of Mindfulness, there were others whose knowledge was because of only attaining [knowledge of] correct severance, because of attaining spiritual accomplishments, because of attaining [spiritual] faculties, because of attaining [spiritual] powers, and because of attaining the factors of awakening in the same way.

「復有一類得八支聖道故、得八支聖道相故、得八支聖道能治所治故、得八支聖道修故、得八支聖道未生令生故、得八支聖道生已堅住不忘倍修增廣故，記別所解。

There was another type whose understanding was because of attaining [knowledge of] the Noble Eightfold Path, attaining [knowledge of] the characteristics of the Noble Eightfold Path, attaining knowledge of the states controlled by the Noble Eightfold Path, and attaining [knowledge of] the Noble Eightfold Path arising from a state of being non-arisen, and attaining [knowledge of] its assured non-forgetfulness after arising, and its broadening from repeated practice.”

「世尊！我見彼已竊作是念：『此諸長老依有所得現觀，各說種種相法，記別所解。當知彼諸長老，一切皆懷增上慢，為增上慢所執持故，於勝義諦遍一切一味相，不能解了。』是故，世尊！甚奇！乃至世尊！善說！如世尊言：『勝義諦相，微細、最微細，甚深、最甚深，難通達、最難通達，遍一切一味相。』世尊！此聖教中修行苾芻，於勝義諦遍一切一味相尚難通達，況諸外道。」

“World-Honored One! When I saw this, I thought to myself, ‘All these venerables, based upon the insight(s) each had attained, explain the various characteristics of the Dharma according to their understanding. One should know, all those venerables expressed their understanding with pride, and because they have pride they are unable to comprehend the characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning that pervades everything as a single flavor. For this reason, World-Honored One! How rare! The World-Honored One has well explained! Like the World-Honored One said, ‘The characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning is subtle, most subtle, is profound, most profound, is difficult to fathom, most difficult to fathom, pervading everything as a characteristic of a “single flavor” (*eka-rasatā*).’ World-Honored One! If among these practicing sages (monastics) it is difficult to fathom this characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning that pervades everything as a single flavor, how much more so for those of ‘outside ways’ (i.e. heretics)?”       **

爾時，世尊告長老善現曰：「如是，如是。善現！我於微細最微細、甚深最甚深、難通達最難通達，遍一切一味相勝義諦，現正等覺；現等覺已，為他宣說、顯示、開解、施設、照了。何以故？善現！我已顯示於一切蘊中清淨所緣，是勝義諦。我已顯示於一切處、緣起、食、諦、界、念住、正斷、神足、根、力、覺支、道支中清淨所緣，是勝義諦。此清淨所緣於一切蘊中，是一味相、無別異相；如於蘊中，如是於一切處中，乃至一切道支中，是一味相、無別異相。是故，善現！由此道理，當知勝義諦是遍一切一味相。

Then the World-Honored One said to the elder Subhūti, “So it is. So it is. Subhūti! I have correctly awakened to the subtle, most subtle, the profound, most profound, difficult to penetrate, most difficult to penetrate truth of ultimate meaning which pervades everything as a characteristic of a ‘single flavor’. Having correctly awakened, I explain it to others, point out, analyze, define, and illuminate it. How so? Subhūti! I have already pointed out that the purity of conditions within all the aggregates is the truth of ultimate meaning. I have already pointed out that the purity of conditions among all bases, dependent origination, sustenance, Truth(s), realms, Foundations of Mindfulness, correct severance, spiritual accomplishments, faculties, powers, factors of awakening, and the Path is the truth of ultimate meaning. This purification of the conditions among all the aggregates is of the characteristic of a ‘single flavor’, an undifferentiatable characteristic. And, as among the aggregates, so too among all the bases up to and including all the factors of the Path, they are of the characteristic of a ‘single flavor’, an undifferentiatable characteristic. For this reason, Subhūti! Only from this path of logic, you should know that the truth of ultimate meaning is a characteristic that pervades everything as a single flavor.”

「復次，善現！修觀行苾芻，通達一蘊真如勝義法無我性已，更不尋求各別餘蘊、諸處、緣起、食、諦、界、念住、正斷、神足、根、力、覺支、道支真如勝義法無我性。唯即隨此真如勝義無二智為依止，故於遍一切一味相勝義諦，審察趣證。是故，善現！由此道理，當知勝義諦是遍一切一味相。

Furthermore, Subhūti! *Bhikṣus* cultivating observational practices, having penetrated the ultimate meaning of the true suchness of the selfless nature of a single aggregate, need not seek further the ultimate meaning of the true suchness of the selfless nature of each different aggregate, base, dependency, sustenance, Truth, realm, Foundation of Mindfulness, correct severance, spiritual accomplishment, faculty, power, factor of awakening, or factor of the Path. Solely by going along with this nondual wisdom of the true suchness of ultimate meaning as a foundation does one come to awareness and realization of the all-pervading ‘single flavor’ characteristic of the truth of ultimate meaning. For this reason, Subhūti! Only from this path of logic, you should know that the truth of ultimate meaning is the characteristic of a ‘single flavor’ that pervades everything.”     **

「復次，善現！如彼諸蘊展轉異相，如彼諸處、緣起、食、諦、界、念住、正斷、神足、根、力、覺支、道支，展轉異相。若一切法真如勝義法無我性亦異相者，是則真如勝義法無我性亦應有因，從因所生。若從因生應是有為，若是有為應非勝義，若非勝義應更尋求餘勝義諦。善現！由此真如勝義法無我性，不名有因，非因所生，亦非有為，是勝義諦，得此勝義更不尋求餘勝義諦。唯有常常時、恒恒時，如來出世、若不出世，諸法法性安立，法界安住。是故，善現！由此道理，當知勝義諦是遍一切一味相。

Furthermore, Subhūti! Just as all the aggregates are described as [having] different characteristics, so too, all the bases, dependencies, sustenances, Truths, realms, Foundations of Mindfulness, correct severances, spiritual accomplishments, faculties, powers, factors of awakening and factors of the Path are describes as [having] different characteristics. If, like these, the ultimate meaning of the true suchness of the selfless nature of all dharmas was also differentiated, then the ultimate meaning of the true suchness of the selfless nature of *dharmas* should have a cause, they would arise from a cause. If arisen from a cause, then it would be conditioned, and if it is something conditioned then it is not ultimate meaning, and if it is not ultimate meaning then one would need to seek further for the truth ultimate meaning. Subhūti! Since the ultimate meaning of the true suchness of the selfless nature of all *dharmas* is not said to be caused, does not arise from causes and is not conditioned, it is the truth of ultimate meaning. One who attains this ultimate meaning does not need to further search for the truth of ultimate meaning. Only upon the eternally eternal, constantly constant establishment of the Dharmadhatu is the dharmic nature of all dharmas established, whether a Thus Come One appears in the world or not. For this reason, Subhūti! Only from this path of logic you should know, the truth of ultimate meaning is the characteristic of a ‘single flavor’ that pervades everything.”

「善現！譬如種種非一品類異相色中，虛空無相、無分別、無變異、遍一切一味相。如是，異性、異相一切法中，勝義諦遍一切一味相，當知亦然。」

Subhūti! Just as how among all the various kinds of different and similar types of characteristics and forms of things, space is characteristicless, without differentiation and without change, an all-pervading characteristic of a single flavor. Like this, among the different natures and different characteristics of all *dharmas*, the truth of ultimate meaning pervades everything as a characteristic of a ‘single flavor’.

爾時，世尊欲重宣此義，而說頌曰：

At that time, the World Honored One, wanting to emphasis this meaning, spoke in verse saying:

此遍一切一味相，　　
勝義諸佛說無異；　
若有於中異分別，　　
彼定愚癡依上慢。」

This characteristic of a ‘single flavor’ that pervades everything,
Is no different than the ultimate meaning explained by all buddhas.
If there is any difference or differentiation between them,
That is certainly ignorant and prideful.
## Chapter 3 - The Characteristics Mind, Thought, and Consciousness

心意識相品第三
Chapter 3 - The Characteristics of Mind, Thought, and Consciousness

爾時，廣慧菩薩摩訶薩白佛言：「世尊！如世尊說：『於心意識祕密善巧菩薩。』於心意識祕密善巧菩薩者，齊何名為於心意識祕密善巧菩薩？如來齊何施設彼為於心意識祕密善巧菩薩？」說是語已。

At that time, the bodhisattva mahasattva Viśālamati (’Vast Intellect’) said to the Buddha, “World-Honored One! As the World-Honored One has spoken of, ‘bodhisattvas skilled in the secrets of mind, thought, and consciousness.’ Why is a bodhisattva skilled in the secrets of mind, thought, and consciousness called a bodhisattva skilled in the secrets of mind, thought, and consciousness? Why has the Thus Come One given the description of them as bodhisattvas skilled in the secrets of  mind (*citta*), thought (*manas*), and consciousness (*vijñāna*)?”

爾時，世尊告廣慧菩薩摩訶薩曰：「善哉，善哉！廣慧！汝今乃能請問如來如是深義；汝今為欲利益安樂無量眾生，哀愍世間、及諸天、人、阿素洛等；為令獲得義利安樂，故發斯問。汝應諦聽，吾當為汝說心意識祕密之義。

Then the World-Honored One told Viśālamati bodhisattva mahasattva, “Excellent, excellent! Viśālamati ! You are now able to ask the Thus Come One about the profound meaning of this. You now generate this question because you desire to benefit and gladden immeasurable sentient beings, with compassion for the world and all the gods, humans, and asuras, in order for them to realize the meaning, to benefit them, and to gladden them. You should listen closely. I will explain for you the meaning of he mysteries of the mind, thought, and consciousness?”

「廣慧當知，於六趣生死彼彼有情，墮彼彼有情眾中，或在卵生、或在胎生、或在濕生、或在化生，身分生起，於中最初一切種子心識成熟、展轉、和合、增長、廣大。依二執受：一者、有色諸根及所依執受；二者、相名分別言說戲論習氣執受。有色界中具二執受，無色界中不具二種。

“Viśālamati, you should know, all those various beings within the six destines of life & death fall into different types of beings. Whether born of an egg, born of a womb, born of moisture, or born by transformation, their bodies separate and arise, within which, from the very beginning, all the seeds of mind-consciousness (*citta vijñāna*) develop, transforms, comes together, grows and expands depending upon two appropriations: 1. The appropriation of material senses and what they depend on, and 2. the appropriation of the propensity toward differentiating characteristics by names and verbal fabrications. Within the realm of form there are these two appropriations. Within the formless realm there are not these two kinds.”

「廣慧！此識亦名阿陀那識。何以故？由此識於身隨逐執持故。亦名阿賴耶識。何以故？由此識於身攝受、藏隱、同安危義故。亦名為心。何以故？由此識色聲香味觸等積集滋長故。

“Viśālamati! This consciousness is also called *ādānavijñāna* (’clinging consciousness’). Why? Because this consciousness follows and clings to the body. It is also called *ālayavijñāna*. Why? because this consciousness embraces the body, is stored within it, jointly at peace and in peril. It is also known as mind (*citta*). Why? Because this consciousness accumulates and amplifies forms, sounds, scents, flavors, tactile feelings, and so on.”

「廣慧！阿陀那識為依止、為建立故，六識身轉，謂眼識、耳、鼻、舌、身、意識。此中有識：眼及色為緣生眼識，與眼識俱隨行，同時、同境，有分別意識轉。有識：耳、鼻、舌、身，及聲、香、味、觸為緣，生耳、鼻、舌、身識，與耳、鼻、舌、身識俱隨行，同時、同境，有分別意識轉。廣慧！若於爾時一眼識轉，即於此時唯有一分別意識，與眼識同所行轉。若於爾時二、三、四、五諸識身轉，即於此時唯有一分別意識，與五識身同所行轉。

“Viśālamati! With the *ādānavijñāna* as a basis, as a foundation, the six consciousnesses of the body (r)evolve, which are eye consciousness, ear, nose, tongue, body, and thought consciousness. Within this there is consciousness: with eye and form as a condition there arises eye-consciousness. Along with eye-consciousness there is also, at the same time, with the same objective reference, a differentiating thought consciousness (*manasvijñāna*) that (r)evolves. There is consciousness: with ear, nose, tongue, body, and sounds, scents, flavors, and tactile feelings as conditions there arises ear, nose, tongue and body consciousness. Along with ear, nose, tongue and body consciousness there is also, at the same time, with the same objective reference, a differentiating thought consciousness (*manasvijñāna*) that (r)evolves. Viśālamati! If at some point in time a single visual consciousness (r)evolves, then at this time there will only be a single differentiating thought consciousness that (r)evolves along with visual consciousness. If, at some point in time, there are two, three, four, or five bodily consciousnesses (r)evolving, then at this time there will only be a single differentiating thought consciousness that (r)evolves along with these five bodily consciousnesses.”       **

「廣慧！譬如大瀑水流，若有一浪生緣現前，唯一浪轉；若二、若多浪生緣現前，有多浪轉。然此瀑水自類恒流無斷無盡。又如善淨鏡面，若有一影生緣現前，唯一影起；若二、若多影生緣現前，有多影起。非此鏡面轉變為影，亦無受用滅盡可得。

Viśālamati! Just like a great torrent of flowing water, if the conditions for one wave are present, only one wave will (r)evolve. If the conditions for two or more waves are present, many waves will (r)evolve. Yet this torrent of water, itself, flows constantly, without interruption or cessation. It is also like the surface of a very clean mirror. If the conditions for one image are present, then only one image will appear. If the conditions for two or more images are present, then many images will appear. It is not that the surface of the mirror changes into images, and no end to its function can be found.”

「如是，廣慧！由似瀑流阿陀那識為依止、為建立故，若於爾時有一眼識生緣現前，即於此時一眼識轉；若於爾時乃至有五識身生緣現前，即於此時五識身轉。

Like this, Viśālamati! With the torrential flow of the *ādānavijñāna* as a basis, as a foundation, if at some point in time there are the conditions for a single visual consciousness to arise, then at this time a single visual consciousness (r)evolves. If, at some point in time there are the conditions for five bodily consciousnesses to arise, then at this time five bodily consciousnesses will (r)evolve.”

「廣慧！如是菩薩雖由法住智為依止、為建立故，於心意識祕密善巧。然諸如來不齊於此，施設彼為於心意識一切祕密善巧菩薩。廣慧！若諸菩薩於內各別：如實不見阿陀那、不見阿陀那識；不見阿賴耶、不見阿賴耶識；不見積集、不見心；不見眼色及眼識；不見耳聲及耳識；不見鼻香及鼻識；不見舌味及舌識；不見身觸及身識；不見意法及意識；是名勝義善巧菩薩；如來施設彼為勝義善巧菩薩。廣慧！齊此名為於心意識一切祕密善巧菩薩；如來齊此施設彼為於心意識一切祕密善巧菩薩。」

Viśālamati! Like this, bodhisattvas, with the wisdom of abiding in the Dharma as a basis, as a foundation, are skilled in the secrets of mind, thought, and consciousness, yet it is not on this account that the Thus Come One describes them as skilled in the secrets of mind, thought, and consciousness. Viśālamati! If all bodhisattvas within themselves truly do not see *ādāna*, (appropriation), do not see *ādānavijñāna*, do not see *ālaya* (storage), do not see *ālayavijñāna*, do not see accumulation (*cita-sthaṃ*), do not see mind (*citta*), do not see the eyes, forms or eye-consciousness, do not see ears, sounds, and ear-consciousness, do not see the nose, scents, and nose-consciousness, do not see the tongue, tastes, or tongue consciousness, do not see the body, tactile feelings, or body-consciousness, do not see thought, thoughts, or thought-consciousness, this is called being a bodhisattva skilled in ultimate meaning and are described by the Thus Come One as bodhisattvas skilled in ultimate meaning. Viśālamati! It is on this account that they are called bodhisattvas skilled in the secrets of mind, thought, and consciousness, and are so described by
the Thus Come One.”

爾時，世尊欲重宣此義，而說頌曰：

Then, the World Honored One, to emphasize the meaning of this, said in verse:

阿陀那識甚深細，　　
一切種子如瀑流，　
我於凡愚不開演，　　
恐彼分別執為我。」

The *Ādānavijñāna* is profound and subtle,
All seeds are like a torrential flow,
I do not explain it to the ignorant,
Fearing that it be differentiated and clung to as a self.
## Chapter 4 - The Characteristic of all Dharmas

一切法相品第四
Chapter 4 - The Characteristic of all Dharmas

爾時，德本菩薩摩訶薩白佛言：「世尊！如世尊說：『於諸法相善巧菩薩。』於諸法相善巧菩薩者，齊何名為於諸法相善巧菩薩？如來齊何施設彼，為於諸法相善巧菩薩？」說是語已。

At that time, Guṇākara (’Root of Virtue’) bodhisattva mahasattva  asked the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! The World-Honored One has spoken of ‘bodhisattvas skilled in the characteristics of all things (*dharmas*).’ Why is a bodhisattva skilled in the characteristics of all things **called a bodhisattva skilled in the characteristics of all things? Why has the Thus Come One given the description of them as bodhisattvas skilled in the characteristics of all things?”

爾時，世尊告德本菩薩曰：「善哉！德本！汝今乃能請問如來如是深義；汝今為欲利益安樂無量眾生，哀愍世間、及諸天、人、阿素洛等；為令獲得義利安樂故，發斯問。汝應諦聽，吾當為汝說諸法相。

Then the World-Honored One said to Guṇākara bodhisattva, “Excellent! Guṇākara! You are now able to ask the Thus Come One about the profound meaning of this. You now generate this question because you desire to benefit and gladden immeasurable sentient beings, with compassion for the world and all the gods, humans, and asuras, in order for them to realize the meaning, to benefit them, and to gladden them. You should listen closely. I will explain for you the meaning of he mysteries of the mind, thought, and consciousness?”

「謂諸法相略有三種，何等為三？一者、遍計所執相；二者、依他起相；三者、圓成實相。云何諸法遍計所執相？謂一切法名假安立自性差別，乃至為令隨起言說。云何諸法依他起相？謂一切法緣生自性，則此有故彼有，此生故彼生，謂無明緣行，乃至招集純大苦蘊。云何諸法圓成實相？謂一切法平等真如。於此真如，諸菩薩眾勇猛精進為因緣故，如理作意，無倒思惟為因緣故，乃能通達。於此通達，漸漸修集，乃至無上正等菩提方證圓滿。

“It is said that there are three kinds of characteristics of all things (*dharmas*). What three? 1. Totally imaginary characteristics (***parikalpita-lakṣaṇa***) that are clung to; 2. The characteristic of arising in dependence upon another (***paratantra-lakṣaṇa***), and 3. The characteristic of complete, perfect reality (***pariniṣpanna-lakṣaṇa***). What are the totally imaginary characteristics of all things that are clung to? This is the establishing of conventional names for all things and distinguishing their self-natures (*svabhava*) in order to talk about them. What is the characteristic of all things arising in dependence upon another? This is the dependently originated nature of all things, and because there is this, there is that. Because this arises, that arises. Ignorance conditions *saṃskāras* and so on, bringing together a great mass of suffering aggregates. What is the characteristic of complete, perfect reality of all things? This is the equanimous, Real Suchness of all things. All bodhisattvas penetrate to this Real Suchness by their courageous determination, intelligent (or logical) focusing, and true reflection. By gradually cultivating this penetration, they reach unsurpassed true awakening and actually realize perfection.”

「善男子！如眩瞖人眼中所有眩瞖過患，遍計所執相當知亦爾。如眩瞖人眩瞖眾相：或髮毛、輪、蜂蠅、巨勝，或復青、黃、赤、白等相差別現前；依他起相當知亦爾。如淨眼人遠離眼中眩瞖過患，即此淨眼本性所行無亂境界；圓成實相當知亦爾。

“Kulaputra! Like the ailment of cataracts (cloudy spots) for someone with cataracts in the eyes, you  should know, the imaginary characteristics of all things that are clung to are also like this. Like the ‘groups of characteristics’ that appear differentiated to someone with cataracts in the eyes, such as hair nets, wheels, flies, seeds, with blue, yellow, red, white colored characteristics, the characteristic of arising in dependence upon another, you should know, is also like this. Like someone with clear eyes, free of the ailments of cataracts in the eyes, the original nature of these pure eyes operating in an unconfused way about the objective world, the characteristic of complete, perfect reality, you should know, is also like this.”

「善男子！譬如清淨頗胝迦寶，若與青染色合，則似帝青、大青、末尼寶像；由邪執取帝青、大青、末尼寶故，惑亂有情。若與赤染色合，則似琥珀末尼寶像；由邪執取琥珀末尼寶故，惑亂有情。若與綠染色合，則似末羅羯多末尼寶像；由邪執取末羅羯多末尼寶故，惑亂有情。若與黃染色合，則似金像；由邪執取真金像故，惑亂有情。

“Kulaputra! Just like a pure crystal (*sphāṭika*) jewel, if combined and tinted with the color blue, it appears to be the image of a royal blue, a great blue maṇi jewel. Because it takes on the appearance of the image of a royal blue, great blue maṇi jewel, it confuses sentient beings. If combined and tinted with the color red, it appears to be in the image of a ruby maṇi jewel (or amber, *aśmagarbha*). Because it takes on the appearance of the image of a ruby maṇi jewel, it confuses sentient beings. If combined and tinted with the color green, it appears to be in the image of an emerald maṇi jewel. Because it takes on the appearance of the image of an emerald maṇi jewel, it confuses sentient beings. If combined and tinted with the color yellow, it appears to a golden image. Because it takes on the appearance of a real golden image, it confuses sentient beings.”

「如是，德本！如彼清淨頗胝迦上，所有染色相應；依他起相上，遍計所執相言說習氣，當知亦爾。如彼清淨頗胝迦上，所有帝青、大青、琥珀、末羅羯多、金等邪執；依他起相上遍計所執相執，當知亦爾。如彼清淨頗胝迦寶；依他起相，當知亦爾。如彼清淨頗胝迦上，所有帝青、大青、琥珀、末羅羯多、真金等相，於常常時，於恒恒時，無有真實、無自性性，即依他起相上，由遍計所執相，於常常時、於恒恒時，無有真實、無自性性；圓成實相，當知亦爾。

“Like this, Guṇākara! Just as those tinted colors appear upon that pure crystal, the propensities of language about totally imaginary characteristics upon the characteristic of arising in dependence upon another, you should know, are also like this. Just as those falsely perceived royal blues, great blues, rubies, emeralds and gold appear upon that pure crystal, grasping the imaginary characteristics upon the characteristic of arising in dependence upon another, you should know, is also like this. Just like that pure crystal jewel, the characteristic of arising in dependence upon another, you should know, is also like this. Just as those royal blues, great blues, rubies, emeralds and real gold that appear upon that pure crystal are always, forever without ever having any real existence, of a nature without self-nature, imaginary characteristics upon the characteristic of arising in dependence upon another that is always, forever without ever having any real existence, of a nature without self-nature, you should know, the characteristic of complete, perfect reality, is also like this.”

「復次，德本！相名相應以為緣故，遍計所執相而可了知；依他起相上，遍計所執相執以為緣故，依他起相而可了知；依他起相上，遍計所執相無執以為緣故，圓成實相而可了知。

“Furthermore, Guṇākara! Due to the interdependence of characteristics and names, totally imaginary characteristics can be understood. Due to the interdependence of grasping and the totally imaginary characteristics upon the characteristic of arising in dependence upon another, the characteristic of arising in dependence upon another can be understood. Due to the interdependence of not grasping and the characteristic of being grasped as something circumscribed upon the characteristic of arising in dependence upon another, the characteristic of complete, perfect reality can be understood.

「善男子！若諸菩薩能於諸法依他起相上，如實了知遍計所執相，即能如實了知一切無相之法；若諸菩薩如實了知依他起相，即能如實了知一切雜染相法；若諸菩薩如實了知圓成實相，即能如實了知一切清淨相法。

“Kulaputra! If bodhisattvas are able to understand, as they really are, all dharmas totally imaginary characteristics upon the characteristic of arising in dependence upon another, they then will be able to understand, as it really it, the characteristiclessness of things. If bodhisattvas are able to understand, as it really is, the characteristic of arising in dependence upon another, they then will be able to understand, as it really is, the defilement of all things. If bodhisattvas are able to understand, as it really is, the characteristic of complete, perfect reality, they then will be able to understand, as it really is, the purity of all things.”

「善男子！若諸菩薩能於依他起相上，如實了知無相之法，即能斷滅雜染相法；若能斷滅雜染相法，即能證得清淨相法。

‘Kulaputra! If bodhisattvas understand, as it really is, the ‘characteristiclessness thing’ upon the characteristic of arising in dependence upon another, then they are able to cut off and cease  defilements. If they are able to cut off and cease defilements, then they are able to realize attainment of things as purified.”

「如是，德本！由諸菩薩如實了知遍計所執相、依他起相、圓成實相故；如實了知諸無相法、雜染相法、清淨相法；如實了知無相法故，斷滅一切雜染相法，斷滅一切染相法故，證得一切清淨相法。齊此名為於諸法相善巧菩薩；如來齊此施設彼為於諸法相善巧菩薩。」

“Like this, Guṇākara! Since all bodhisattvas understand, as they really are, imagined characteristics, the characteristic of arising in dependence upon another, and the the characteristic of complete, perfect reality, they understand, as they really are, the characteristiclessness of things, things characterized as defiled, and things characterized as pure. Because they understand, as it really is, the characteristiclessness of things, they cut off and cease all defilements, and because they cut off and cease all defilements, they realize attainment of all purified things. Thus, a bodhisattva is called a bodhisattva skilled in the characteristics of all *dharmas*? The Thus Come One has therefore given the description of them as bodhisattvas skilled in the characteristics of all *dharmas.”*

爾時，世尊欲重宣此義，而說頌曰：

Then, the World Honored One, to emphasize the meaning of this, said in verse:

若不了知無相法，　　
雜染相法不能斷；　
不斷雜染相法故，　　
壞證微妙淨相法。

One who does not understand the characteristiclessness of things,
Is unable to cut off defiled things,
And since not cutting off defiled things,
Ruining realization of the wonderous, pure characteristic of things.

不觀諸行眾過失，　　
放逸過失害眾生；　
懈怠住法動法中，　　
無有失壞可憐愍。」

Not observing the errors of all *saṃskāras,*
One indulges in errors and harms sentient beings,
Lazy (*kausīdya*) among abiding and moving things,
How could someone so lost not be pitiable?
## Chapter 5 - The Characteristic of Being without Self-Nature

爾時，勝義生菩薩摩訶薩白佛言：「世尊！我曾獨在靜處，心生如是尋思：『世尊以無量門曾說：「諸蘊所有自相，生相、滅相，永斷、遍知。」如說諸蘊，諸處、緣起、諸食亦爾。以無量門曾說：「諸諦所有自相，遍知、永斷、作證、修習。」以無量門曾說：「諸界所有自相、種種界性、非一界性、永斷、遍知。」以無量門曾說：「念住所有自相、能治、所治、及以修習，未生令生、生已堅住，不忘、倍修、增長、廣大。」如說念住、正斷、神足、根、力、覺支，亦復如是。以無量門曾說：「八支聖道所有自相、能治、所治、及以修習，未生令生、生已堅住，不忘、倍修、增長、廣大。」』世尊復說：『一切諸法皆無自性、無生、無滅、本來寂靜、自性涅槃。』未審世尊依何密意作如是說：『一切諸法皆無自性、無生、無滅、本來寂靜、自性涅槃。』我今請問如來斯義，惟願如來哀愍解釋，說一切法皆無自性、無生、無滅、本來寂靜、自性涅槃所有密意。」

At that time, Paramārathasamudgata (’Born of Ultimate Truth’) bodhisattva mahasattva said to the Buddha, “World-Honored One! I was once alone in a quiet place and I thought to myself: ‘The
World-Honored One in an immeasurable number of teachings has explained, “the inherent characteristics (*svalakṣaṇa*) of the aggregates, the characteristic of their arising, the characteristic of their destruction, their complete severance, and their being totally understood.” Just as all the aggregates have been explained, all the bases (*āyatana*), dependent origination (*pratītyasamutpāda*), and sustenance (*āhāra*) have also [been explained]. With an immeasurable number of teachings he has explained, “the specific characteristics of the [noble] truths, their being totally understood, complete severance, their realization, and the practices [that lead to their realization].” With an immeasurable number of teachings he has explained, “the inherent characteristics of realms, the various natures of realms, the different nature of realms, their complete severance, and their being totally understood.” With an immeasurable number of teachings he has explained, “the inherent characteristics of the foundations of mindfulness, their being able to control [mental states], which [states] are controlled, how, by practice, what has not yet arisen can be produced, how what has already arisen can be maintained, their
unforgettableness, their repeated practice, their increase and their broadening.” Just as the foundations of mindfulness have been explained, correct severance, the spiritual path, [spiritual] faculties, [spiritual] powers, and the factors of awakening are also like this. With an immeasurable number of teachings he has explained, “the inherent characteristics of the Noble Eightfold Path, their being able to control [mental states], which [states] are controlled, how, by practice, what has not yet arisen can be produced, how what has already arisen can be maintained, their
unforgettableness, their repeated practice, their increase and their broadening.” The World-Honored One has also explained, “all *dharmas* are completely without inherent nature (*svabhāva*), are without arising (*anutpāda*), without ceasing (*anirodha*), are originally quiescent (*śānti*) with the inherent nature of Nirvāṇa.” I wondered, based on what secret intent did the World-Honored One explain that, “all *dharmas* are completely without inherent nature, are without arising, without ceasing, are originally quiescent with the inherent nature of Nirvāṇa?” I now kindly ask about the Thus Come One’s meaning, only wanting the Thus Come One to compassionately dispense (instruct) and explain what the secret intent is of explaining that all *dharmas* are completely without inherent nature, are without arising, without ceasing, are originally quiescent with the inherent nature of Nirvāṇa.”

爾時，世尊告勝義生菩薩曰：「善哉，善哉！勝義生！汝所尋思，甚為如理。善哉，善哉！善男子！汝今乃能請問如來如是深義，汝今為欲利益安樂無量眾生，哀愍世間、及諸天、人、阿素洛等，為令獲得義利安樂故，發斯問。汝應諦聽，吾當為汝解釋所說『一切諸法皆無自性、無生、無滅、本來寂靜、自性涅槃所有密意。』

Then, the World-Honored One told Paramārathasamudgata, “Excellent, excellent! Paramārathasamudgata! Your reasoning is most logical. Excellent, excellent! Kulaputra! You are now able to question the Thus Come One concerning this profound meaning. You now raise this question because you desire to benefit and gladden immeasurable sentient beings, for you have compassion for the world and all its devas, humans, and asuras, so that they may be led to attain meaning, benefit, and happiness. Listen closely and I will dispense my secret intent in explaining that all *dharmas* are completely without inherent nature, are without arising, without ceasing, are originally quiescent with the inherent nature of Nirvāṇa.

「勝義生！當知我依三種無自性性密意，說言一切諸法皆無自性，所謂相無自性性、生無自性性、勝義無自性性。

Paramārathasamudgata! You should know, I have explained that all *dharmas* are completely without inherent nature relying on the secret intent of three kinds of natures without inherent nature (*nisvabhava-bhava*?), which are, [1] the nature of **characteristics** lacking inherent nature, [2] the nature of **arising** lacking inherent nature, and [3] the nature of **ultimate meaning** (*paramārtha*) lacking inherent nature.”

「善男子！云何諸法相無自性性？謂諸法遍計所執相。何以故？此由假名安立為相，非由自相安立為相，是故說名相無自性性。

“Kulaputra! What is the nature of the **characteristics** of all *dharmas* lacking inherent nature? This is all *dharmas*’ characteristic of being grasped as something circumscribed. How so? It is only upon conventional names that characteristics come to be established, it is not by their own characteristics that characteristics are established, for this reason, the nature of characteristics are said to lack inherent nature.”

「云何諸法生無自性性？謂諸法依他起相。何以故？此由依他緣力故有，非自然有，是故說名生無自性性。

“What is the nature of the **arising** of all dharmas lacking inherent nature? This is the characteristic of all dharmas arising in dependence upon another. How so? It is only in dependence upon the power of conditionality that there is (being, existence, are things), [things] do not exist of themselves, for this reason, the nature of arising is said to lack inherent nature.”

「云何諸法勝義無自性性？謂諸法由生無自性性故，說名無自性性；即緣生法，亦名勝義無自性性。何以故？於諸法中，若是清淨所緣境界，我顯示彼以為勝義無自性性，依他起相非是清淨所緣境界，是故亦說名為勝義無自性性。復有諸法圓成實相，亦名勝義無自性性。何以故？一切諸法法無我性名為勝義，亦得名為無自性性，是一切法勝義諦故，無自性性之所顯故。由此因緣，名為勝義無自性性。

“What is the nature of the **ultimate meaning** of all *dharmas* lacking inherent nature? This is because, since the nature of the arising of all dharmas lacks inherent nature, nature is said to lack inherent nature. Conditionally arisen *dharmas* are then also called the nature of the ultimate meaning of all *dharmas* lacking inherent nature. How so? Among all *dharmas*, if it is a purified conditional realm, I reveal (preach) that to be the nature of the ultimate meaning of all dharmas lacking inherent nature. Characteristics that depend upon another are not a purified conditional realm. For this reason, it has also been said that this is called the nature of the ultimate meaning lacking inherent nature. Furthermore, all *dharmas* characteristic of complete, perfect reality is also called the nature of the ultimate meaning lacking inherent nature. How so? The self-less nature of all *dharmas* is called the ultimate meaning, it is also known as the nature of being without inherent nature (*nisvabhava-bhava*). Because this is the Truth of Ultimate Meaning of all *dharmas*, because this is the nature of being without inherent nature of which I preach, for these reasons it is known as the nature of the ultimate meaning of all *dharmas* lacking inherent nature.”

「善男子！譬如空花，相無自性性，當知亦爾。譬如幻像，生無自性性，當知亦爾；一分勝義無自性性，當知亦爾。譬如虛空，惟是眾色無性所顯，遍一切處；一分勝義無自性性，當知亦爾，法無我性之所顯故，遍一切故。

“Kulaputra! Just like flowers in the sky, you should know, the nature of characteristics lacking inherent nature is also like this. Just like magical illusions, you should know, the nature of the arising of all dharmas lacking inherent nature is also like this. And, you should know, one part of the nature of the ultimate meaning of all *dharmas* lacking inherent nature is also like this. Just like empty space is manifested everywhere by the absence of material forms, you should know, another part of the nature of the ultimate meaning of all dharmas lacking inherent nature is also like this because it manifests everywhere by the selfless nature of all dharmas.”

「善男子！我依如是三種無自性性，密意說言：『一切諸法皆無自性。』

“Kulaputra! Relying on three kinds of natures without inherent nature like this, I have explained with the secret intent, ‘all *dharmas* are completely lacking inherent nature.’”

「勝義生！當知，我依相無自性性，密意說言：『一切諸法無生、無滅、本來寂靜、自性涅槃。』何以故？若法自相都無所有，則無有生；若無有生，則無有滅；若無生無滅，則本來寂靜；若本來寂靜，則自性涅槃。於中都無少分所有更可令其般涅槃故。是故我依相無自性性，密意說言：『一切諸法無生、無滅、本來寂靜、自性涅槃。』

“Paramārathasamudgata! You should know, relying on the nature of the characteristics of all *dharmas* lacking inherent nature, I have explained with the secret intent, ‘All *dharmas* are completely without inherent nature, are without arising, without ceasing, are originally quiescent with the inherent nature of Nirvāṇa.’ How so? If the characteristics of *dharmas* do not exist unto themselves, then they do not have any arising. If there is no arising, there is no cessation, and if there is no arising and no ceasing, then originally quiescent. If originally quiescent, then of the inherent nature of Nirvāṇa, wherein there is not the slightest part that could be led once again to Parinirvāṇa. For this reason, relying on the nature of the characteristics of all *dharmas* lacking inherent nature, I have explained with the secret intent, ‘All *dharmas* are completely without inherent nature, are without arising, without ceasing, are originally quiescent with the inherent nature of Nirvāṇa.’

「善男子！我亦依法無我性所顯勝義無自性性，密意說言：『一切諸法無生、無滅、本來寂靜、自性涅槃。』何以故？法無我性所顯勝義無自性性，於常常時、於恒恒時，諸法法性、安住、無為。一切雜染不相應故，於常常時、於恒恒時，諸法法性安住故無為，由無為故無生無滅；一切雜染不相應故，本來寂靜、自性涅槃。是故我依法無我性所顯勝義無自性性，密意說言：『一切諸法無生、無滅、本來寂靜、自性涅槃。』

“Kulaputra!” Also, relying on the nature of the ultimate meaning manifested in the selfless nature of *dharmas* lacking inherent nature, I have explained with the secret intent, ‘All *dharmas* are completely without inherent nature, are without arising, without ceasing, are originally quiescent with the inherent nature of Nirvāṇa’ How so? The nature of the ultimate meaning manifested in the selfless nature of *dharmas* lacking inherent nature is for all times and forever all dharmas dharmic nature peacefully abiding unconditioned. Since all the defilements do not appear, for all times and forever all dharmas dharmic nature peacefully abides unconditioned, and since unconditioned, without arising or ceasing. Since all the defilements do not appear, originally quiescent, the inherent nature of Nirvāṇa. For this reason, relying on the nature of the ultimate meaning manifested in the selfless nature of *dharmas* lacking inherent nature, I have explained with the secret intent, ‘All *dharmas* are completely without inherent nature, are without arising, without ceasing, are originally quiescent with the inherent nature of Nirvāṇa’”

「復次，勝義生！非由有情界中諸有情類，別觀遍計所執自性為自性故，亦非由彼別觀依他起自性及圓成實自性為自性故，我立三種無自性性；然由有情於依他起自性及圓成實自性上，增益遍計所執自性故，我立三種無自性性。

“Furthermore, Paramārathasamudgata! I do not propose these three kinds of natures without inherent nature among different sentient beings in the world, because some would regard the nature of being grasped as something circumscribed as having inherent nature, or they would regard the nature of arising in dependence upon another or the nature of complete, perfect reality as having inherent nature. Rather, it is because sentient beings superimpose the nature of being grasped as something circumscribed upon the nature of arising in dependence upon another and the nature of complete, perfect reality that I propose three kinds of natures without inherent nature.”

「由遍計所執自性相故，彼諸有情於依他起自性及圓成實自性中，隨起言說。如如隨起言說如是如是，由言說熏習心故、由言說隨覺故、由言說隨眠故，於依他起自性及圓成實自性中，執著遍計所執自性相。

“Due to the characteristic of having the inherent nature of being grasped as something circumscribed, all those sentient beings within the inherent nature of arising in dependence upon another and the inherent nature of complete perfect reality create explanations. And so, creating explanations like this about such and such, because the explanations condition their minds, because their awareness conforms to the explanations, because they are lulled by the explanations, within the nature of arising in dependence upon another and the nature of complete perfect reality they become attached to the characteristic of having the nature of being grasped as something circumscribed.”

「如如執著如是如是，於依他起自性及圓成實自性上，執著遍計所執自性；由是因緣，生當來世依他起自性；由此因緣，或為煩惱雜染所染、或為業雜染所染、或為生雜染所染，於生死中長時馳騁、長時流轉，無有休息，或在那落迦、或在傍生、或在餓鬼、或在天上、或在阿素洛、或在人中，受諸苦惱。

“As such, being attached to such and such, they are attached to the inherent nature of being grasped as something circumscribed that is superimposed upon the inherent nature of arising in dependence upon another and the inherent nature of complete perfect reality. Due to co-dependent origination, they will be born in lives to come with the inherent nature of arising in dependence upon another. Due to this co-dependent origination, they become tainted with the taint of the afflictions, tainted with the taint of karma, tainted with the taint of birth, and they gallop about through birth & death (*samsara*) for a long time, floating about endlessly for a long time, perhaps in a *naraka* (’hell realm’), or as an animal, or hungry ghost, or in the heavens above, or with the asura, or among humans, receiving all kinds of suffering.”

「復次，勝義生！若諸有情從本已來，未種善根，未清淨障，未成熟相續，未多修勝解，未能積集福德、智慧二種資糧。我為彼故，依生無自性性宣說諸法。彼聞是已，能於一切緣生行中，隨分解了無常、無恒，是不安隱變壞法已，於一切行，心生怖畏，深起厭患；心生怖畏，深厭患已，遮止諸惡，於諸惡法能不造作，於諸善法能勤修習。習善因故，未種善根能種善根，未清淨障能令清淨，未熟相續能令成熟。由此因緣，多修勝解，亦多積集福德、智慧二種資糧。

“Furthermore, Paramārathasamudgata! If there are those people who have not yet planted roots of goodness, who have not yet purified obstacles, who have not yet matured their continuity (’mindstream’ *citta-santāna*), who have not yet cultivated liberation, who have not yet been able to accumulate merit and wisdom, the two kinds of ‘supplies’ (*saṃbhāra*), it is for them that I explain the Dharma relying upon the nature of arising lacking inherent nature. When they hear this, they will be able to understand, in part, that all conditionings (*saṃskāra*), which are dependently co-arisen, are impermanent, inconstant, not comforting, grievously transient, and destructive. Then their minds will produce deep dread and detestation for all conditioned states. When this has happened, then they will reject all evil. When they no longer do evil, they will be able to cultivate and practice good. And, practicing good, they will be able to plant roots of goodness not previously planted, they will be able to purify obstacles not previously purified, they will be able to mature their continuities not previously matured. Because of this they will cultivate liberation and accumulate the two ‘supplies’ of merit and wisdom.”

「彼雖如是種諸善根，乃至積集福德、智慧二種資糧；然於生無自性性中，未能如實了知相無自性性及二種勝義無自性性。於一切行未能正厭、未正離欲，未正解脫，未遍解脫煩惱雜染、未遍解脫諸業雜染、未遍解脫諸生雜染。如來為彼更說法要，謂相無自性性及勝義無自性性。為欲令其於一切行能正厭故、正離欲故、正解脫故，超過一切煩惱雜染故、超過一切業雜染故、超過一切生雜染故。

Even though they cultivate good roots and accumulate the two kinds of ‘supplies’, merit and wisdom, they are nevertheless as yet unable to truly know the nature of characteristics lacking inherent existence and the two kinds of natures of ultimate meaning lacking inherent existence. So they cannot yet truly be disaffected with all conditionings and are not yet truly detached from desire or yet truly liberated. They are not yet totally liberated from the taint of affliction, they are not yet totally liberated from the taint of karma, and they are not yet totally liberated from the taint of birth. It is for them that the Thus Come One has gone on to explain the Dharma in terms of the nature of characteristics lacking inherent nature and the nature of ultimate meaning lacking inherent nature. It is from a desire for them to be correctly disaffected with all conditionings, so that they can be correctly freed from desire and correctly liberated, so that they can transcend the taint of the afflictions, the taint of karma, and the taint of birth.”

「彼聞如是所說法已，於生無自性性中，能正信解相無自性性及勝義無自性性，簡擇思惟，如實通達；於依他起自性中，能不執著遍計所執自性相。由言說不熏習智故、由言說不隨覺智故、由言說離隨眠智故，能滅依他起相；於現法中智力所持，能永斷滅當來世因。由此因緣，於一切行能正厭患、能正離欲、能正解脫，能遍解脫煩惱、業、生三種雜染。

“After they have heard an explanation of the Dharma like this, they will be able to correctly believe and understand the nature of characteristics lacking inherent nature and the nature of ultimate truth lacking inherent nature within the nature of arising lacking inherent existence, pondering, thinking, and really penetrating [it]. Within the nature of arising in dependence upon another, they are able to not cling to the inherent nature of the characteristic of being grasped as something circumscribed. Due to wisdom not conditioned by language, due to awakened wisdom not conforming to language, due to wisdom freed from inclinations toward language, they
are able to bring to cessation the characteristic of arising in dependence upon another. Sustained by the wisdom power of this Dharma, they will eternally be able to sever all causes for future [rebirths] forever. Due to this dependent origination, they will be able to correctly detest all conditioning, they will be able to correctly sever all desires and be correctly liberated. They will be able to be entirely liberated from the three taints of affliction, karma, and birth.”

「復次，勝義生！諸聲聞乘種性有情，亦由此道此行迹故，證得無上安隱涅槃。諸獨覺乘種性有情、諸如來乘種性有情，亦由此道此行迹故，證得無上安隱涅槃。一切聲聞、獨覺、菩薩，皆共此一妙清淨道，皆同此一究竟清淨，更無第二。我依此故，密意說言：『唯有一乘。』非於一切有情界中，無有種種有情種性，或鈍根性、或中根性、或利根性有情差別。

“Furthermore, Paramārathasamudgata! All those sentient beings who belong to the Voice Hearer vehicle, because they follow this path, will realize unsurpassed, quiescent cessation. All sentient beings who belong to the Solitary Enlightened One vehicle or to the vehicle of the Thus Come One, because they follow this path, will realize unsurpassed, quiescent cessation. For all Voice Hearers, Solitary Enlightened Ones, and bodhisattvas, this is the one wondrous path of purification. This is the one ultimate purification. There is no second. It is with this secret intent that I have explained, ‘There is only one vehicle.’ It is not that in the realm of sentient beings there are not sentient beings of various different lineages, for some are dull in understanding, some are not so dull, and some are
quick in understanding.”

「善男子！若一向趣寂聲聞種性，雖蒙諸佛施設種種勇猛加行方便化導，終不能令當坐道場證得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。何以故？由彼本來唯有下劣種性故、一向慈悲薄弱故、一向怖畏眾苦故。由彼一向慈悲薄弱，是故一向棄背利益諸眾生事；由彼一向怖畏眾苦，是故一向棄背發起諸行所作。我終不說一向棄背利益眾生事者、一向棄背發起諸行所作者，當坐道場，能得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提，是故說彼名為一向趣寂聲聞。若迴向菩提聲聞種性補特伽羅，我亦異門說為菩薩。何以故？彼既解脫煩惱障已，若蒙諸佛等覺悟時，於所知障，其心亦可當得解脫。由彼最初為自利益，修行加行脫煩惱障，是故如來施設彼為聲聞種性。

“Kulaputra! Someone turned exclusively toward the quiescence of the Voice Hearer lineage, even if they were to be skillfully led by the courageous perseverance of all the Buddhas, they would be unable to be led to sit upon the site of enlightenment and realize *anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi*. How so? This is so because from their origin they possess only an inferior lineage, because their compassion has been weak, because they have lived in fear of suffering. Since their compassion has been weak, they have turned their backs upon deeds that benefit and gladden all sentient beings. Since they have lived in fear of suffering, they have turned their backs upon engendering any conditioning. I have never taught that one who turns their back upon deeds to benefit and gladden all sentient beings, who turns their back upon engendering conditioning, will sit upon the site of enlightenment and realize *anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi*. Therefore, I teach that such persons are exclusively turned toward the quiescence of the Voice Hearer lineage. If one transfers (*pariṇāmanā*) the *pudgala* (personality) of being of the Voice Hearer linage toward *bodhi*, I would then describe that as being a bodhisattva. How so? Having already been liberated from the hindrance of the afflictions, when they receive the Awakened Equality of all Buddhas, their mind will also be able to attain liberation from all hindrances of knowledge. Because they first cultivated practice for their own benefit, practices liberating from the hindrance of the afflictions, for this reason the Thus Come One describes them as being of the Voice Hearer lineage.

「復次，勝義生！如是於我善說善制法毘奈耶，最極清淨意樂所說善教法中，諸有情類意解種種差別可得。善男子！如來但依如是三種無自性性，由深密意，於所宣說不了義經，以隱密相說諸法要，謂一切法皆無自性、無生、無滅、本來寂靜、自性涅槃。

“Furthermore, Paramārathasamudgata! Various differences can be found in people's understandings of my well-explained, well-ordered Dharma and Vinaya; good Dharma explained with the purest intent. Kulaputra! The Thus Come One only relies on three kinds of nature lacking inherent nature like this in explaining the import of all Dharma using ‘secret characteristics’ with a profound, secret intent, throughout the proclaimed sutras of incomplete meaning, which is to say, that all *dharmas* are completely without inherent nature, are without arising, without ceasing, are originally quiescent with the inherent nature of Nirvāṇa.”

「於是經中，若諸有情已種上品善根、已清淨諸障、已成熟相續、已多修勝解，已能積集上品福德、智慧資糧，彼若聽聞如是法已，於我甚深密意言說，如實解了，於如是法，深生信解，於如是義，以無倒慧，如實通達。依此通達善修習故，速疾能證最極究竟；亦於我所深生淨信，知是如來、應、正等覺於一切法現正等覺。

“Regarding what is in this sutra, if all the sentient beings who already have superior, good roots, who have already purified all hindrances, who have already matured continuities, who have already cultivated liberation, who have already been able to accumulate the ‘supplies’ of superior merit and wisdom, when they hear Dharma like this, they will truly understand the secret intent of my words and will give rise to a profound faith in and understanding of this Dharma, for they will truly penetrate its meaning with infallible understanding. Because they rely on this good cultivation of penetration, they will quickly be able to realize the ultimate stage and, because of their profoundly engendered pure faith in me, they will know this is the Thus Come One, Worthy One, Correctly Awakened One manifesting the correct awakening of all *dharmas*.”

「若諸有情，已種上品善根、已清淨諸障、已成熟相續、已多修勝解，未能積集上品福德、智慧資糧。其性質直，是質直類，雖無力能思擇廢立，而不安住自見取中。彼若聽聞如是法已，於我甚深祕密言說，雖無力能如實解了，然於此法能生勝解，發清淨信，信此經典，是如來說，是其甚深，顯現甚深，空性相應，難見難悟，不可尋思，非諸尋思所行境界、微細詳審聰明智者之所解了。於此經典所說義中，自輕而住，作如是言：『諸佛菩提為最甚深，諸法法性亦最甚深，唯佛如來能善了達，非是我等所能解了。諸佛如來，為彼種種勝解有情，轉正法教；諸佛如來無邊智見，我等智見猶如牛跡。』於此經典，雖能恭敬，為他宣說，書寫護持，披閱，流布，殷重供養，受誦溫習；然猶未能以其修相發起加行，是故於我甚深密意所說言辭，不能通達。由此因緣，彼諸有情，亦能增長福德、智慧二種資糧，於彼相續未成熟者，亦能成熟。

“If all the sentient beings who already have planted superior, good roots, who have already purified all hindrances, who have already matured continuities, who have already cultivated liberations, [but] who have not yet been able to accumulate the ‘supplies’ of superior merit and wisdom, [yet] their disposition is upright. Someone with this type of upright disposition, while without the power to be able to think discerningly about propositions, does not dwell fixed in attachment to their own views. When they hear Dharma like this, they will not have the power to be able to truly understand the secret intent of my words, yet they are able to bring about a supreme understanding of this Dharma, generate pure faith and believe in this sutra, ‘This is the teaching of the Thus Come One, this is that most profound revelation, that most profound characteristic of the nature of emptiness that is difficult to see, difficult to comprehend, incapable of being rationalized nor within any sphere of rationalization, something subtle and refined understood only by the brilliantly wise. They abide in this sutra with humility and say: ‘The *bodhi* of all the Buddhas is profound indeed! All dharmas dharmic nature is also profound indeed! Only the Buddha Tathagatas are able to understand it well, for it is not something we are able to understand. For the sake of sentient beings of various dispositions, all the Buddha Tathagatas have turned the Wheel of the Correct Dharma, for the wisdom and insight of all Buddha Tathagatas is infinite, while our wisdom and insight follows in their wake.’ Although they are able to revere this sutra and declare it to others, to copy it and protect it, to unroll it and disseminate it, to venerate and honor it, to recite it and review it, yet they will still be incapable of the effort of practicing it, and thus they will be incapable of penetrating the underlying intent of my words. But those sentient beings will be able to increase the ‘supplies’ of merit and wisdom, and they will be able to mature the continuities [of their consciousnesses] that have not been matured.

「若諸有情，廣說乃至未能積集上品福德、智慧資糧，性非質直，非質直類，雖有力能思擇廢立，而復安住自見取中。彼若聽聞如是法已，於我甚深密意言說不能如實解了。於如是法雖生信解，然於其義隨言執著，謂一切法決定皆無自性，決定不生不滅，決定本來寂靜，決定自性涅槃。由此因緣，於一切法獲得無見及無相見。由得無見無相見故，撥一切相皆是無相，誹撥諸法遍計所執相、依他起相、圓成實相。何以故？由有依他起相及圓成實相故，遍計所執相方可施設；若於依他起相及圓成實相見為無相，彼亦誹撥遍計所執相，是故說彼誹撥三相。雖於我法起於法想，而非義中起於義想；由於我法起法想故，及非義中起義想故，於是法中持為是法，於非義中持為是義。彼雖於法起信解故，福德增長；然於非義起執著故，退失智慧；智慧退故，退失廣大無量善法。

“If all the sentient beings who, as already explained up to not yet being able to accumulate the ‘supplies’ of superior merit and wisdom, [but] their disposition is not upright, and although they do have the ability to think discerning about propositions, yet, abiding in their own views, if they hear Dharma like this, they will be unable truly to understand the secret intent of my words. Even if they were to bring about faith and understanding in Dharma like this, they would only be clinging to the words that express the meaning, that is: that all *dharmas* are completely without inherent nature, are without arising, without ceasing, are originally quiescent with the inherent nature of Nirvāṇa.
Consequently, they take up the view of nihilism and the nonexistence of all characteristics. Due to this view of nihilism and the nonexistence of all characteristics, they negate all characteristics as lacking characteristics, and erroneously negate the characteristics of all dharmas being grasped as something circumscribed, the characteristic of arising in dependence upon another, and the characteristic of complete perfect reality. How so? It is only because of the characteristic of arising in dependence upon another and the characteristic of complete perfect reality the characteristic of being grasped as something circumscribed can be designated. If, then, in dispensing with and negating the characteristic of being grasped as something circumscribed, they regard the characteristic of arising in dependence upon another and the characteristic of complete perfect reality as lacking characteristics, they in fact dispense with and negate all three characteristic patterns. They do form concepts about my Dharma, but, in their negation of meaning, they do not form concepts of its meaning. Because, while forming concepts of my Dharma, in their negation of meaning, they do not form concepts of its meaning. They do maintain this Dharma, but they do not maintain its meaning. Nevertheless, because they have engendered faith and understanding in regard to this Dharma, their merit will increase, but they will turn away from and lose wisdom because they engender clinging to what is meaningless. Because they turn away from wisdom, they will lose that wide, immeasurable good Dharma.”

「復有有情，從他聽聞，謂法為法，非義為義，若隨其見，彼即於法起於法想，於非義中起於義想，執法為法、非義為義。由此因緣，當知同彼退失善法。若有有情不隨其見，從彼欻聞一切諸法皆無自性、無生、無滅、本來寂靜、自性涅槃，便生恐怖，生恐怖已，作如是言：『此非佛語，是魔所說。』作此解已，於是經典，誹謗、毀罵。由此因緣，獲大衰損，觸大業障。由是緣故，我說若有於一切相起無相見，於非義中宣說為義，是起廣大業障方便；由彼陷墜無量眾生，令其獲得大業障故。

“Yet other sentient beings hear from them and take what is called the Dharma as the Dharma, and what is not meaningful as meaning. If they follow that view, they will give rise to a perception of dharmas (*dharma-saṃjñā*) about the Dharma, and from what is not meaning they will give rise to a perception of meaning, taking Dharma as the Dharma, and what is not meaningful as meaning. From this interdependence, you should know, they likewise turn away from and lose the Good Dharma. If there are sentient beings who do not follow that view, who suddenly hear from them, ‘All *dharmas* are completely without inherent nature, are without arising, without ceasing, are originally quiescent with the inherent nature of Nirvāṇa’ and they become fearful. Having become fearful they say things like, ‘This is not what the Buddha said. These are the words of Mara.’ Having thought like this about this sutra, they refute (*apavāda*) and slander [it]. Due to these conditions, I have explained, if one has the view that all characteristics are without characteristics, and from what is not meaningful explains it to be meaningful, this brings about a immensely great karmic hindrance (upaya?), and because they beguile countless sentient beings, they cause them also to attain great karmic hindrances.”

「善男子！若諸有情，未種善根、未清淨障、未熟相續、無多勝解，未集福德、智慧資糧。性非質直，非質直類，雖有力能思擇廢立，而常安住自見取中。彼若聽聞如是法已，不能如實解我甚深密意言說，亦於此法不生信解，於是法中起非法想，於是義中起非義想。於是法中執為非法，於是義中執為非義，唱如是言：『此非佛語，是魔所說。』作此解已，於是經典，誹謗毀罵，撥為虛偽，以無量門，毀滅摧伏如是經典，於諸信解此經典者起怨家想。彼先為諸業障所障，由此因緣，復為如是業障所障，如是業障，初易施設，乃至齊於百千俱胝那庾多劫，無有出期。

“Kulaputra! If all the sentient beings who have not yet planted superior, good roots, who have not yet purified all hindrances, who have not yet matured continuities, without much liberation, who have not yet been able to accumulate the ‘supplies’ of superior merit and wisdom, without an upright disposition. The type of person without an upright disposition, without the power to be able to think discerningly about propositions, dwelling fixed in attachment to their own views.  When they hear Dharma like this, they will not be able to truly understand the secret intent of my words, and do not give rise to liberating faith in this Dharma. They will form the perception that this Dharma is not Dharma and that this meaning is not meaning. Clinging to the idea that this Dharma is not Dharma and that this meaning is not meaning, they announce their evaluation, saying: ‘This is not what the Buddha said. These are the words of Mara.’ Having thought like this about this sutra, they refute and slander, discard it as false, and destroy and refute it in innumerable ways,
considering all those who have faith in it to be their enemies. They are already hindered by their karma, and because of that are now further hindered by this karma. This karmic hindrance is easily set up at first, but eventually there is no escape for hundreds of thousands of millions of *kotis* of *nayutas* of kalpas.”

「善男子！如是於我善說善制法、毘奈耶，最極清淨意樂所說善教法中，有如是等諸有情類意解種種差別可得。」

“Kulaputra! Like this, various differences can be found in people's understandings of my well-explained, well-ordered Dharma and Vinaya; good Dharma explained with the purest intent.”

爾時，世尊欲重宣此義，而說頌曰：

Then, the World Honored One, to emphasize the meaning of this, said in verse:

一切諸法皆無性，　　
無生無滅本來寂，　
諸法自性恒涅槃。　　
誰有智言無密意？

Every *dharma* is completely without nature,
Without arising, without ceasing, originally quiescent,
The inherent nature of all dharmas is ever Nirvāṇa.
Who with wisdom could say there is no secret intent?

相生勝義無自性，　　
如是我皆已顯示；　
若不知佛此密意，　　
失壞正道不能往！

Characteristics, arising, and ultimate meaning lack inherent nature,
Thus is what I have revealed,
If one does not know the secret intent of the Buddha,
They miss the correct path and are unable to go on!

依諸淨道清淨者，　　
惟依此一無第二，　
故於其中立一乘，　　
非有情性無差別。

The pure who rely on the pure paths
Rely only upon this, there is no second,
Therefore within this is established the Single Vehicle,
Yet it is not that the nature of sentient beings is without differentiation

眾生界中無量生，　　
惟度一身趣寂滅，　
大悲勇猛證涅槃，　　
不捨眾生甚難得！

Immeasurable beings within the realms of sentient beings,
Deliver only one life [i.e. themselves] to tranquility,
[While] those of great compassion and courage who realize Nirvana
And do not relinquish sentient beings are most rare to encounter!

微妙難思無漏界，　　
於中解脫等無差，　
一切義成離惑苦，　　
二種異說謂常樂。」

In the subtle, difficult to conceive realm of no outflows
Liberation is equanimous, without differentiation;
All meaning achieves transcendence of confusion and suffering,
Duality and difference, and is what is called eternal bliss.

爾時，勝義生菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！諸佛如來密意語言，甚奇！希有！乃至微妙最微妙！甚深最甚深！難通達最難通達！

At that time, Paramārathasamudgata said to the Buddha, “World-Honored One! The secret intent of the words of all Buddha Tathagatas is rare, most indeed! It is subtle, most subtle! It is profound, most profound! It is difficult to penetrate, most difficult to penetrate!”

「如是我今領解世尊所說義者：若於分別所行遍計所執相所依行相中，假名安立以為色蘊，或自性相、或差別相；假名安立為色蘊生、為色蘊滅、及為色蘊永斷、遍知，或自性相、或差別相，是名遍計所執相。世尊依此施設諸法相無自性性。若即分別所行遍計所執相所依行相，是名依他起相。世尊依此施設諸法生無自性性，及一分勝義無自性性。如是我今領解世尊所說義者：若即於此分別所行遍計所執相所依行相中，由遍計所執相不成實故，即此自性無自性性法無我真如清淨所緣，是名圓成實相。世尊依此施設一分勝義無自性性。如於色蘊，如是，於餘蘊皆應廣說；如於諸蘊如是，於十二處，一一處中皆應廣說；於十二有支，一一支中皆應廣說；於四種食，一一食中皆應廣說；於六界、十八界，一一界中皆應廣說。

“As I understand the meaning of what the Buddha has said: if, among the differentiated conditioned characteristics (*saṃskāra-lakṣaṇa*) upon which are based the characteristic of being grasped as something circumscribed one establishes conventional names like the aggregate of form, or its characteristic of inherent nature, or its differentiating characteristics, and establishes conventional names like the birth of the aggregate of form, the extinction of the aggregate of form, the eternal severance and total knowledge of the aggregate of form, or their characteristic of inherent nature, or their differentiating characteristics, this is called the characteristic of being grasped as something circumscribed. The World-Honored One defines the nature of all dharmas’ characteristics lacking inherent nature on this basis.”

“If it is just the differentiated conditioned characteristics upon which are based the characteristic of being grasped as something circumscribed, this is called the characteristic of arising in dependence upon another. The World-Honored One defines the nature of the arising of all dharmas lacking inherent nature and one part of the nature of ultimate meaning lacking inherent nature on this basis.”

“As I understand the meaning of what the Buddha has said, if it is just among differentiated conditioned characteristics that the characteristic of being grasped as something circumscribed is based, and, because the characteristic of being grasped as something circumscribed amounts to nothing real, and this condition of the inherent nature of something (*dharma*) lacking inherent nature, without self, truly thus and pure, this is called the characteristic of complete, perfect reality. The World-Honored One defines one part of the nature of ultimate truth lacking inherent nature on this basis. The aggregate of form and the other aggregates should be explained like this. Just as all the aggregates are, the twelve bases, each of the bases should be explained like this. This is how each of the twelve limbs of existence should be explained. This is how each of the four sustenances should be explained, the six realms, the eighteen realms, each of the realms should be explained like this.”

“As I understand the meaning of what the Buddha has said, if, among the differentiated conditioned characteristics upon which are based the characteristic of being grasped as something circumscribed one establishes conventional names like the Truth of Suffering, the total knowledge of the Truth of Suffering, or its characteristic of inherent nature, or its differentiating characteristics, this is called the characteristic of being grasped as something circumscribed.

“If it is just the differentiated conditioned characteristics upon which are based the characteristic of being grasped as something circumscribed, this is called the characteristic of arising in dependence upon another.

The World-Honored One defines one part of the nature of ultimate truth lacking inherent nature on this basis. The Truth of Suffering and the other Truths should be explained like this. As the Noble Truths are like this, everything within the Foundations of Mindfulness, Right Effort, the Spiritual Steps (*ṛddhipāda*), the Faculties, Powers, Factors of Awakening, and Factors of the Path, each and every one should be explained like this.

「如是我今領解世尊所說義者：若於分別所行遍計所執相所依行相中，假名安立以為正定，及為正定能治所治，若正修未生令生，生已堅住不忘，倍修增長廣大，或自性相、或差別相，是名遍計所執相。世尊依此施設諸法相無自性性。若即分別所行遍計所執相所依行相，是名依他起相。世尊依此施設諸法生無自性性，及一分勝義無自性性。如是我今領解世尊所說義者：若即於此分別所行遍計所執相所依行相中，由遍計所執相不成實故，即此自性無自性性法無我真如清淨所緣，是名圓成實相。世尊依此施設諸法一分勝義無自性性。

The World-Honored One defines the nature of all dharmas’ characteristics lacking inherent nature on this basis.”

“If it is just the differentiated conditioned characteristics upon which are based the characteristic of being grasped as something circumscribed, this is called the characteristic of arising in dependence upon another. The World-Honored One defines the nature of the arising of all dharmas lacking inherent nature and one part of the nature of ultimate meaning lacking inherent nature on this basis.”

“As I understand the meaning of what the Buddha has said, if it is just among differentiated conditioned characteristics that the characteristic of being grasped as something circumscribed is based, and, because the characteristic of being grasped as something circumscribed amounts to nothing real, and this condition of the inherent nature of something (*dharma*) lacking inherent nature, without self, truly thus and pure, this is called the characteristic of complete, perfect reality. The World-Honored One defines one part of the nature of ultimate truth lacking inherent nature on this basis.”

「世尊！譬如毘濕縛藥，一切散藥、仙藥方中，皆應安處。如是，世尊！依此諸法皆無自性、無生、無滅、本來寂靜、自性涅槃，無自性性了義言教，遍於一切不了義經，皆應安處。

“World-Honored One! Just as dried ginger is placed into all effective medicines, it will totally be found there. Just so, World-Honored One! This teaching based upon the complete meaning that all *dharmas* are completely without inherent nature, are without arising, without ceasing, are originally quiescent with the inherent nature of Nirvāṇa, of a nature lacking inherent nature pervades throughout sutras of incomplete meaning, it will totally be found there.”

「世尊！如彩畫地，遍於一切彩畫事業皆同一味，或青、或黃、或赤、或白，復能顯發彩畫事業。如是，世尊！依此諸法皆無自性廣說乃至自性涅槃，無自性性了義言教，遍於一切不了義經，皆同一味，復能顯發彼諸經中所不了義。

“World-Honored One! Just like the background of a colorful painting pervades throughout all the colors of the painted work with an identical, single ’flavor’ (or hue), whether blue, yellow, red, or white, and is then able to reveal the paintwork. Like this, World-Honored One! This teaching based upon the complete meaning that all *dharmas* are completely without inherent nature, are without arising, without ceasing, are originally quiescent with the inherent nature of Nirvāṇa, of a nature lacking inherent nature pervades throughout sutras of incomplete meaning, completely with an identical, single flavor, and is then able to reveal that within all the sutras of incomplete meaning.

「世尊！譬如一切成熟珍羞諸餅果內，投之熟酥，更生勝味。如是，世尊！依此諸法皆無自性，廣說乃至自性涅槃，無自性性了義言教，置於一切不了義經，生勝歡喜。

“World-Honored One! Just as the addition of warm cheese to cooked delicacies like cakes or fruit produces a greater flavor. Like this, World-Honored One! This teaching based upon the complete meaning that all *dharmas* are completely without inherent nature, as explained above, are originally quiescent with the inherent nature of Nirvāṇa, of a nature lacking inherent nature, added to the sutras of incomplete meaning, produces greater joy.”

「世尊！譬如虛空遍一切處，皆同一味，不障一切所作事業。如是，世尊！依此諸法皆無自性廣說乃至自性涅槃，無自性性了義言教，遍於一切不了義經，皆同一味，不障一切聲聞、獨覺及諸大乘所修事業。」說是語已。

“World-Honored One! Just as space pervades everywhere, completely with an identical, single flavor, not obstructing any activity. Like this, World-Honored One! This teaching based upon the complete meaning that all *dharmas* are completely without inherent nature, as explained above, are originally quiescent with the inherent nature of Nirvāṇa, of a nature lacking inherent nature, pervades throughout the sutras of incomplete meaning, completely with an identical, single flavor, not obstructing any Voice Hearer, Solitary Enlightened One or all the activities of the Mahayana.” This is what he said.

爾時，世尊歎勝義生菩薩曰：「善哉，善哉！善男子！汝今乃能善解如來所說甚深密意言義；復於此義善作譬喻，所謂世間毘濕縛藥，雜彩畫地，熟酥，虛空。勝義生！如是，如是！更無有異！如是，如是！汝應受持。」

Then, the World-Honored One praised Paramārathasamudgata saying, “Excellent, excellent! Kulaputra! You have now been able to well understand the secret intent of the words of the Thus Come One.  Also the meaning was well done with the similes of the dried ginger, the background of a colorful painting, the warm cheese, and empty space. Paramārathasamudgata! Just so, just! Not different at all. Just so, just so! It is exactly as you have remembered. ”

爾時勝義生菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！初於一時在婆羅痆斯仙人墮處，施鹿林中，惟為發趣聲聞乘者，以四諦相轉正法輪。雖是甚奇、甚為希有，一切世間諸天、人等，先無有能如法轉者。而於彼時所轉法輪，有上、有容，是未了義，是諸諍論安足處所。

At that time, Paramarthasamudgata Bodhisattva addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! “In the beginning, in the country of Benares at the resort of seers, in the Deer Park, the World-honored One first turned the Wheel of the Correct Dharma by the characteristics of the Four Truths only for those generating the Voice Hearer Vehicle. This was marvelous and most rare, Dharma such as nobody, whether gods or humans, had been able to turn in the world before. However, at the time of this turning, there was something superior, there was room, and this lack of understanding led to all kind of interpretations and occasioned controversy.”

「世尊！在昔第二時中，惟為發趣修大乘者，依一切法皆無自性、無生、無滅、本來寂靜、自性涅槃，以隱密相轉正法輪。雖更甚奇、甚為希有，而於彼時所轉法輪，亦是有上、有所容受，猶未了義，是諸諍論安足處所。

“World-Honored One! During the second period of time, only for those generating the cultivation of the Great Vehicle, [you] turned the Wheel of the Correct Dharma by characteristics with a secret intent based upon all dharmas being completely without inherent nature, without arising, without ceasing, being originally quiescent with the inherent nature of Nirvāṇa. This was marvelous and most rare, however, at the time of this turning, there was also something superior, there was still room, and this lack of understanding led to all kind of interpretations and occasioned controversy.”

「世尊！於今第三時中，普為發趣一切乘者，依一切法皆無自性、無生、無滅、本來寂靜、自性涅槃、無自性性，以顯了相轉正法輪。第一甚奇、最為希有。于今世尊所轉法輪無上無容，是真了義，非諸諍論安足處所。

“World-Honored One! Now, during the third period, universally for those generating every vehicle, you turn the Wheel of the Correct Dharma by revelatory characteristics based upon the nature of all dharmas being completely without inherent nature, without arising, without ceasing, being originally quiescent with the inherent nature of Nirvāṇa, lacking inherent nature. The most marvelous, absolutely most rare! No turning of any Dharma Wheel in the world is superior, there is no room. This is the meaning of truth, without interpretation or place for controversy.”

「世尊！若善男子或善女人，於此如來依一切法皆無自性、無生、無滅、本來寂靜、自性涅槃，所說甚深了義言教，聞已信解、書寫、護持、供養、流布、受誦、修習、如理思惟，以其修相發起加行，生幾所福？」說是語已。

“World-Honored One! If virtuous men or virtuous women, upon hearing such a profound teaching based upon the complete meaning that all *dharmas* are completely without inherent nature, are without arising, without ceasing, are originally quiescent with the inherent nature of Nirvāṇa, believe in it with understanding, copy, protect, honor, and spread it about, reciting and practicing it with logic and reason, how much merit would they bring about by their having generated the cultivation of such practice?” This is what he said.

爾時，世尊告勝義生菩薩曰：「勝義生！是善男子或善女人，其所生福無量無數難可喻知，吾今為汝略說少分。如爪上土比大地土，百分不及一，千分不及一，百千分不及一，數算、計喻、鄔波尼殺曇分亦不及一。或如牛跡中水比四大海水，百分不及一，廣說乃至鄔波尼殺曇分亦不及一。如是，於諸不了義經，聞已信解、廣說乃至以其修相發起加行所獲功德，比此所說了義經教，聞已信解所集功德，廣說乃至以其修相發起加行所集功德，百分不及一，廣說乃至鄔波尼殺曇分亦不及一。」說是語已。

At that time, the World-Honored One said to Paramarthasamudgata Bodhisattva, “Paramarthasamudgata! The merit produced by these virtuous men or virtuous women would be immeasruable, incalcuable, difficult to know. I can but suggest a small part of it for you, like a bit of dirt on one’s fingernail in comparison to the earth. It does not amount to one-hundredth part, nor one-thousandth part, nor one-hundred-thousandth part. It cannot be reckoned as even the tiniest part. Or it is like the pool in a cow’s tracks compared to the waters of the four great oceans, which does not reach one-hundredth part, etc. Such would be the merit attained by hearing and believing and by the effort expended to meditate upon the teaching of the sutras of incomplete meaning. But even this does not come to one-hundredth, not to the tiniest part of the merit attained by hearing and believing and by the effort expended in meditating upon this sutra of complete meaning.” This is what he said.

爾時，勝義生菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！於是解深密法門中，當何名此教？我當云何奉持？」

At that time, Paramarthasamudgata Bodhisattva said to the Buddha, “World-Honored One! How should we call this teaching from within this dharma door that reveals the profound secret?”

佛告勝義生菩薩曰：「善男子！此名勝義了義之教；於此勝義了義之教，汝當奉持。」

The Buddha told Paramarthasamudgata, “Paramarthasamudgata! This is called the Teaching of the Complete Meaning of Supreme Meaning. You should uphold this Teaching of the Complete Meaning of Supreme Meaning.”

說此勝義了義教時，於大會中，有六百千眾生發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心；三百千聲聞遠塵離垢，於諸法中得法眼淨；一百五十千聲聞永盡諸漏心得解脫；七十五千菩薩得無生法忍。

When this Complete Meaning of Supreme Meaning teaching was explained, six hundred thousand sentient beings in the great assembly generated *anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi-citta*; **three hundred thousand voice hearers removed themselves far from defilement and pollution and from this Dharma purified their Dharma Eye; one hundred fifty thousand voice hearers separated themselves definitively from all contaminated states of mind and attained liberation; and seventy-five thousand bodhisattvas attained the patience tolerance of birthlessness.
## Chapter 6 - Vikalpa Yoga ‘Differentiating Yoga’

爾時慈氏菩薩摩訶薩白佛言：「世尊！菩薩何依何住，於大乘中修奢摩他、毘鉢舍那？」

At that time Maitreya Bodhisattva addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! What does the bodhisattva rely upon, how do they cultivate *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* while abiding within the Great Vehicle?”

佛告慈氏菩薩曰：「善男子！當知菩薩法假安立，及不捨阿耨多羅三藐三菩提願，為依、為住，於大乘中修奢摩他、毘鉢舍那。」

The Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva, “Kulaputra! You should know, the conventionally established Bodhisattva Dharma and not relinquishing the vow of *anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi* are the basis, are the abode of the cultivation of *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* within the Great Vehicle.”

慈氏菩薩復白佛言：「如世尊說四種所緣境事：一者、有分別影像所緣境事；二者、無分別影像所緣境事；三者、事邊際所緣境事；四者、所作成辦所緣境事。於此四中，幾是奢摩他所緣境事？幾是毘鉢舍那所緣境事？幾是俱所緣境事？」

Maitreya Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “As the World-Honored One has explained, there are four kinds of conditionally constructed (*ālambana*) objects: First, conditionally constructed objects with differentiated (*vikalpa, or vibhajya*, *vibhaaga*; *parikalpana*; divide, discriminate, discern, reason) images; second, conditionally constructed objects without differentiated images (*nirābhāsa*); third, conditionally constructed objects at the limit of objectification; and fourth, conditionally constructed objects that accomplish the Purpose (Convert the Basis, *āśraya-pārivṛtti*). Among these four, which are conditionally constructed objects of *śamatha*? Which are conditionally constructed objects of *vipaśyanā*? Which are conditionally constructed objects of both?”

佛告慈氏菩薩曰：「善男子！一是奢摩他所緣境事，謂無分別影像；一是毘鉢舍那所緣境事，謂有分別影像；二是俱所緣境事，謂事邊際、所作成辦。」

The Buddha replied to Maitreya Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! One is a conditionally constructed object of *śamatha*, which is to say without differentiated images, one is a conditionally constructed object of *vipaśyanā*, which is to say with differentiated images. Two are the conditionally constructed object of both [*śamatha* and *vipaśyanā*] together, which are the limit of objectification and that which accomplishes the Purpose.”

慈氏菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！云何菩薩依是四種奢摩他、毘鉢舍那所緣境事，能求奢摩他、能善毘鉢舍那？」

Maitreya Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! How is the bodhisattva able to seek *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* based upon these four kinds of conditionally constructed objects of *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā*?

佛告慈氏菩薩曰：「善男子！如我為諸菩薩所說法假安立，所謂契經、應誦、記別、諷誦、自說、因緣、譬喻、本事、本生、方廣、希法、論議。菩薩於此善聽、善受、言善通利、意善尋思、見善通達，即於如所善思惟法，獨處空閑作意思惟。復即於此能思惟心，內心相續，作意思惟。如是正行多安住故，起身輕安及心輕安，是名奢摩他。如是菩薩，能求奢摩他。彼由獲得身心輕安為所依故，即於如所善思惟法，內三摩地所行影像，觀察勝解捨離心相。即於如是三摩地影像所知義中，能正思擇、最極思擇，周遍尋思、周遍伺察，若忍、若樂、若慧、若見、若觀，是名毘鉢舍那。如是菩薩，能善毘鉢舍那。」

The Buddha replied to Maitreya Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! As I have explained, the Dharma in established conventions for all bodhisattvas in all of the sutras, the verses, the prophecies, the hymns, the sayings, the narratives, the parables, the previous actions, the previous lives, the extended discourses, the miraculous dharma (*adbhutadharma*), and the expositions, bodhisattvas listen well to [all of] this, receive it well, the words well understood, the ideas well considered, the view well penetrated, then, alone in a forested place, they think reflectively (*manasikṛta*) upon this well reasoned Dharma. Then, from this, they are able to reflect upon the mind, thinking reflectively upon the inner-mind ‘continuity’ (*santati* or ’mindstream’, *citta-santāna*). From the correct practice of a lot of peaceful abiding like this, there comes about bodily and mental ease. This is called *śamatha*. Like this, bodhisattvas are able to seek *śamatha*. With the attainment of ease of body and mind as a basis, they enter the *saṃskār*-ic imagery of *samādhi* from that well reasoned Dharma, observing and understanding free of the characteristics of mind, having abandoned them. Then, within knowledge of the meaning of the imagery of *samādhi* like this, they are able to correctly investigate, to investigate to the furthest extent, to ponder everything, to examine everything, whether patience, joy, wisdom, vision, or awakening, this is called *vipaśyanā.* Like this, a bodhisattva is able to *vipaśyanā* well.

慈氏菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！若諸菩薩緣心為境，內思惟心，乃至未得身心輕安，所有作意，當名何等？」

Maitreya Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! If bodhisattvas take the conditioned mind as an object of internal reflection upon the mind but have not yet attained ease of body and mind, what should that way of thinking be called?”

佛告慈氏菩薩曰：「善男子！非奢摩他作意，是隨順奢摩他勝解相應作意。」

The Buddha replied to Maitreya Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! That is not a *śamatha* way of thinking. That is thinking that goes along with *śamatha* with an understanding that it is something that should be done.”

「世尊！若諸菩薩乃至未得身心輕安，於如所思所有諸法內三摩地所緣影像作意思惟，如是作意，當名何等？」

“World-Honored One! If bodhisattvas have not yet attained ease of body and mind, and they think reflectively upon the conditional images within *samādhi* that accord with all the Dharma upon which they have reflected, what should that way of thinking be called?”

「善男子！非毘鉢舍那作意，是隨順毘鉢舍那勝解相應作意。」

“Kulaputra! That is not *vipaśyanā* thinking. That is thinking that goes along with *vipaśyanā* with an understanding that it is something that should be done.”

慈氏菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！奢摩他道與毘鉢舍那道，當言有異？當言無異？」

Maitreya Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! The way of *śamatha* and the way of *vipaśyanā*, should it be said that they have a difference? Should it be said that there is no difference?”

佛告慈氏菩薩曰：「善男子！當言非有異、非無異。何故非有異？以毘鉢舍那所緣境心為所緣故。何故非無異？有分別影像非所緣故。」

The Buddha replied to Maitreya Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! It should be said that they neither have a difference nor are they without difference. Why do they not have a difference? Because *vipaśyanā* has the conditionally objective mind as its condition. Why are they not without difference? Because there being differentiated images is not a [*śamatha*] condition.”

慈氏菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！諸毘鉢舍那三摩地所行影像，彼與此心，當言有異？當言無異？」

Maitreya Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! All the *saṃskār*-ic imagery of *vipaśyanā-samādhi*, that and this mind, should it be said that they have a difference? Should it be said that there is no difference?”

佛告慈氏菩薩曰：「善男子！當言無異。何以故？由彼影像唯是識故。善男子！我說識所緣，唯識所現故。」

The Buddha replied to Maitreya Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! It should be said that there is no difference. Why? Because those images are consciousness only. Kulaputra! I have said, the conditions of consciousness are only manifestations of consciousness.”

「世尊！若彼所行影像，即與此心無有異者，云何此心還見此心？」

“World-Honored One! If that *saṃskār*-ic imagery and this mind are something without any difference, how does this mind ‘turn’ to see this mind?”

「善男子！此中無有少法能見少法；然即此心如是生時，即有如是影像顯現。善男子！如依善瑩清淨鏡面，以質為緣還見本質，而謂我今見於影像，及謂離質別有所行影像顯現。如是此心生時，相似有異三摩地所行影像顯現。」

‘Kulaputra! Herein there is not the slightest dharma able to see the slightest dharma. When a mind such as this arises, then *saṃskār*-ic imagery like this appears. Kulaputra! It is like seeing something in the clean, well polished face of a mirror, by which the object conditionally appears to ‘turn’ to see the original object, and it is said, I now see an image, and it is said that, apart from the object, there is the *saṃskār*-ic image that has appeared. Like this, when this mind arises, it appears as if there are differences in the *saṃskār*-ic imagery that appear in *samādhi*.”

「世尊！若諸有情自性而住，緣色等心所行影像，彼與此心亦無異耶？」

“World-Honored One! All of the *saṃskār*-ic imagery of the mind conditioned by form, etc. [appearing to] abide with self nature, are they and this mind also without any difference?

「善男子！亦無有異！而諸愚夫由顛倒覺，於諸影像，不能如實知唯是識，作顛倒解。」

“Kulaputra! They are also without any difference! However, due to their inverted awareness about all images, ignorant people are unable to know as it really is [that they] are consciousness only, having this inverted understanding.”

慈氏菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！齊何當言菩薩一向修毘鉢舍那？」

Maitreya Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! What can be said to be the bodhisattva single-pointed practice of *vipaśyanā*?

佛告慈氏菩薩曰：「善男子！若相續作意唯思惟心相。」

The Buddha replied to Maitreya Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! If the ‘continuity’ reflects only upon the characteristics of mind.”

「世尊！齊何當言菩薩一向修奢摩他？」

“World-Honored One! What can be said to be the bodhisattva single-pointed practice of *śamatha*?

「善男子！若相續作意唯思惟無間心。」

Kulaputra! If the ‘continuity’ reflects only with an uninterrupted mind (*avīci-citta*).

「世尊！齊何當言菩薩奢摩他、毘鉢舍那和合俱轉？」

‘World-Honored One! What can be said to be the bodhisattva union of *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā*?

「善男子！若正思惟心一境性。」

“Kulaputra! If they correctly reflect upon the singular object of mind.”

「世尊！云何心相？」

“World-Honored One! What are the ‘characteristics of mind’?

「善男子！謂三摩地所行有分別影像，毘鉢舍那所緣。」

“Kulaputra! They are the differentiated images of the *saṃskāra* in *śamatha*, which are the conditions for *vipaśyanā*.

「世尊！云何無間心？」

“World-Honored One! What is an ‘uninterrupted mind’?”

「善男子！謂緣彼影像心，奢摩他所緣。」

“Kulaputra! It is that conditional, imaginary mind, which is the condition for *śamatha.”*

「世尊！云何心一境性？」

“World-Honored One! What is the ‘singular object of mind’?”

「善男子！謂通達三摩地所行影像，唯是其識；或通達此已，復思惟如性。」

“Kulaputra! It is penetrating the *saṃskār*-ic imagery of *samādhi* as being consciousness only; and after having penetrated this, then further reflecting upon its thus nature.”

慈氏菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！毘鉢舍那凡有幾種？」

Maitreya Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! How many kinds of *vipaśyanā* are there?”

佛告慈氏菩薩曰：「善男子！略有三種：一者、有相毘鉢舍那；二者、尋求毘鉢舍那；三者、伺察毘鉢舍那。云何有相毘鉢舍那？謂純思惟三摩地所行有分別影像毘鉢舍那。云何尋求毘鉢舍那？謂由慧故，遍於彼彼未善解了一切法中，為善了故，作意思惟毘鉢舍那。云何伺察毘鉢舍那？謂由慧故，遍於彼彼已善解了一切法中，為善證得極解脫故，作意思惟毘鉢舍那。」

The Buddha replied the Maitreya Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! There are three kinds: First, *vipaśyanā* upon characteristics; second, investigative *vipaśyanā*; and third, examining *vipaśyanā*. What is *vipaśyanā* upon characteristics? It is *vipaśyanā* purely reflecting upon the differentiated imagery of the *saṃskāra* [or, practice] of *samādhi*. What is investigative *vipaśyanā*? It is *vipaśyanā* which, through wisdom, attentively reflects upon all those things (*dharma*) not yet well understood in order to understand them well. What is examining *vipaśyanā*? It is *vipaśyanā* which, through wisdom, attentively reflects upon all those things (*dharma*) already well understood in order to well realize all that is understood and to attain ultimate liberation.”

慈氏菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！是奢摩他凡有幾種？」

Maitreya Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! How many kinds of *śamatha* are there?

佛告慈氏菩薩曰：「善男子！即由隨彼無間心故，當知此中亦有三種。復有八種，謂初靜慮乃至非想非非想處，各有一種奢摩他故。復有四種，謂慈、悲、喜、捨四無量中，各有一種奢摩他故。」

The Buddha replied to Maitreya Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! There is being in accord with that uninterrupted mind, you should know, with this there are also three kinds. Furthermore, there are eight kinds, which are first calming up to the base of neither perception nor non-perception, because each are a kind of *śamatha.* Furthermore, there are four kinds, which are friendliness, compassion, joy, and *upekṣā* within the Four Immeasurable, because each are a kind of *śamatha*.     **

慈氏菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！如說依法奢摩他、毘鉢舍那，復說不依法奢摩他、毘鉢舍那。云何名依法奢摩他、毘鉢舍那？云何復名不依法奢摩他、毘鉢舍那？」

Maitreya Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! You have explained *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* based upon the Dharma, and you have further explained *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* that are not based upon the Dharma. What is it that is called ‘*śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* based upon the Dharma’? Furthermore, what is called, ‘*śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* that are not based upon the Dharma’?

佛告慈氏菩薩曰：「善男子！若諸菩薩隨先所受所思法相，而於其義得奢摩他、毘鉢舍那，名依法奢摩他、毘鉢舍那。若諸菩薩不待所受所思法相，但依於他教誡教授，而於其義得奢摩他、毘鉢舍那，謂觀青瘀及膿爛等，或一切行皆是無常、或諸行苦、或一切法皆無有我、或復涅槃畢竟寂靜。如是等類奢摩他、毘鉢舍那，名不依法奢摩他、毘鉢舍那。由依止法得奢摩他、毘鉢舍那，故我施設隨法行菩薩，是利根性；由不依法得奢摩他、毘鉢舍那故，我施設隨信行菩薩，是鈍根性。」

The Buddha replied to Maitreya Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! The *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* supported by the Dharma are that *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* attained through the characteristics of dharmas and their meaning first received and pondered by the bodhisattvas. The *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* not supported by the Dharma are the *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* attained not through the characteristics of dharmas the bodhisattvas have received and pondered, but through the instructions and meanings of other teachings, such as observing decaying and rotting [bodies], or upon the impermanence of all *saṃskāra*, the suffering of all *saṃskāra*, the no-self of all things, or the final quiescence of cessation. Such quietude and vision I designate as not supported by Dharma. But, if they have attained a *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* supported by the Dharma, those bodhisattvas I have designated as followers of the Dharma, and they have keen faculties, while, if they attain a *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* not supported by Dharma, those bodhisattvas I have designated as followers of faith, and they have dull faculties.”

慈氏菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！如說緣別法奢摩他、毘鉢舍那，復說緣總法奢摩他、毘鉢舍那。云何名為緣別法奢摩他、毘鉢舍那？云何復名緣總法奢摩他、毘鉢舍那？」

Maitreya Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! You have explained *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* upon conditionally different *dharma*, and you have also explained *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* upon conditionally unified *dharma*. What is it that is called ‘*śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* upon conditionally different *dharma*’? Furthermore, what is called *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* upon conditionally unified *dharma*?”         **

佛告慈氏菩薩曰：「善男子！若諸菩薩，緣於各別契經等法，於如所受所思惟法，修奢摩他、毘鉢舍那，是名緣別法奢摩他、毘鉢舍那。若諸菩薩，即緣一切契經等法，集為一團、一積、一分、一聚作意思惟：此一切法，隨順真如，趣向真如，臨入真如；隨順菩提，隨順涅槃，隨順轉依，及趣向彼，若臨入彼。此一切法，宣說無量無數善法。如是思惟修奢摩他、毘鉢舍那，是名緣總法奢摩他、毘鉢舍那。」

The Buddha replied to Maitreya Bodhisattva, “Kulaputra! If bodhisattvas cultivate *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* upon each of the various *dharma* in the sutras, etc., Dharma which they have received and reflected upon, this is called *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* upon conditionally different *dharma*. If bodhisattvas take as the object of their reflection the *dharma* in all sutras, etc., gathering them into one whole, one mass, one part, one assemblage. This ‘everything dharma’ is in accord with True Thusness, moving toward True Thusness, on the brink of entering True Thusness; It is in accord with *bodhi,* in accord with Nirvana, in accord with the ‘conversion of the base’, and moving toward that, if on the brink of entering that; This ‘everything dharma’ is proclaimed to be immeasurable, innumerable virtuous dharma. *Śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* reflecting like this, this is called *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* upon conditionally unified dharmas.

慈氏菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！如說緣小總法奢摩他、毘鉢舍那，復說緣大總法奢摩他、毘鉢舍那，又說緣無量總法奢摩他、毘鉢舍那。云何名緣小總法奢摩他、毘鉢舍那？云何名緣大總法奢摩他、毘鉢舍那？云何復名緣無量總法奢摩他、毘鉢舍那？」

Maitreya Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! You have explained *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* upon conditionally minor unified *dharma*, and further explained *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* upon conditionally great unified *dharma*, and you have also explained *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* upon conditionally immeasurable unified *dharma.* What is called *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* upon conditionally minor unified *dharma*? What is called *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* upon conditionally great unified *dharma*? What is called *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* upon conditionally immeasurable unified *dharma*?

佛告慈氏菩薩曰：「善男子！若緣各別契經，乃至各別論義，為一團等作意思惟，當知是名緣小總法奢摩他、毘鉢舍那。若緣乃至所受所思契經等法，為一團等作意思惟，非緣各別，當知是名緣大總法奢摩他、毘鉢舍那。若緣無量如來法教，無量法句文字，無量後後慧所照了，為一團等作意思惟，非緣乃至所受所思，當知是名緣無量總法奢摩他、毘鉢舍那。」

The Buddha replied to Maitreya Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! If one takes as the object of understanding the meaning of each of the **different** sutras and even each of the **different** commentaries, and attentively reflects upon them as one whole, etc., you should this is called *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* upon conditionally minor unified *dharma*. If one takes as the object of understanding the *dharma* in the sutras, which they have received and reflected upon, and attentively reflects upon them as one whole, etc., **without considering them separately**, you should know this is called *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* upon conditionally great unified *dharma*. If one takes as the objects of understanding the immeasurable teachings of the Dharma of the Thus Come One, the immeasurable words and expressions of that Dharma, and the immeasurable clarifications of ever more excellent wisdom, and attentively reflects upon them as one whole, etc., without considering them separately, you should know, this is called *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* upon conditionally immeasurable unified *dharma*.”

慈氏菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！菩薩齊何名得緣總法奢摩他、毘鉢舍那？」

Maitreya Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! When can a bodhisattva be said to have attained *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* upon conditionally unified *dharma*?”

佛告慈氏菩薩曰：「善男子！由五緣故當知名得：一者、於思惟時，剎那剎那融銷一切麁重所依；二者、離種種想得樂法樂；三者、解了十方無差別相無量法光；四者、所作成滿相應淨分無分別相，恒現在前；五者、為令法身得成滿故，攝受後後轉勝妙因。」

The Buddha replied to Maitreya Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! You should know, it is due to five conditions that it is said: First, When reflecting, *kṣaṇa*-to-*kṣaṇa* (’moment to moment’), the foundation of ‘gross heaviness’ is melted away; Second, they transcend all the varieties of perception (*saṁjñā*) and take joy in [the] Dharma; Third, they understand the immeasurable light of the Dharma which has no differentiating characteristics throughout the Ten Directions; Fourth, the pure, undifferentiated characteristic of the characteristics of the fulfillment of what is to be done are constantly present before them; Fifth, To now attain fulfillment of the Dharma Body they embrace (*saṃgraha*) that supreme, wondrous ever-turning cause.”

慈氏菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！此緣總法奢摩他、毘鉢舍那，當知從何名為通達？從何名得？」

Maitreya Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “Word-Honored One! This *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* upon conditionally unified *dharma*, how should we know from what [point] is is called penetration (*prativedha*)? From what [point] is it called attainment?”

佛告慈氏菩薩曰：「善男子！從初極喜地名為通達；從第三發光地乃名為得。善男子！初業菩薩亦於是中隨學作意，雖未可歎，不應懈廢。」

The Buddha replied to Maitreya Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! From the initial stage of Extreme Joy it is called penetration; From the third stage of Light-Maker it is called attainment. Kulaputra! Bodhisattvas just starting out also study and reflect upon all this. Although they are not yet worthy of praise, still they should not slacken or give up."

慈氏菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！是奢摩他、毘鉢舍那，云何名有尋有伺三摩地？云何名無尋唯伺三摩地？云何名無尋無伺三摩地？」

Maitreya Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! This *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā,* what is called *samādhi* with [active] investigation (*vitarka*) and [passive] consideration (*vicāra*)? What is called *samādhi* without investigation and only consideration? And what is called *samādhi* without investigation or consideration?”

佛告慈氏菩薩曰：「善男子！於如所取尋伺法相，若有麁顯領受觀察，諸奢摩他、毘鉢舍那，是名有尋有伺三摩地。若於彼相，雖無麁顯領受觀察，而有微細彼光明念領受觀察，諸奢摩他、毘鉢舍那，是名無尋唯伺三摩地。若即於彼一切法相，都無作意領受觀察，諸奢摩他、毘鉢舍那，是名無尋無伺三摩地。

The Buddha replied to Maitreya Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! If there are ‘gross’ insights received in regard to the characteristics of dharmas one has received for investigation and consideration in  *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā*, this is called *samādhi* with investigation and consideration. If there are no gross insights received in regard to those characteristics, yet there is a subtlety and the mind, in that light, receives an insight in *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā*, this is called *samādhi* without investigation and only consideration. If there is the reception of insight without any effort in regard to the characteristic(s) of all *dharmas* in *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* this is called *Samādhi* without investigation or consideration.

「復次，善男子！若有尋求奢摩他、毘鉢舍那，是名有尋有伺三摩地。若有伺察奢摩他、毘鉢舍那，是名無尋唯伺三摩地。若緣總法奢摩他、毘鉢舍那，是名無尋無伺三摩地。」

“Furthermore, Kulaputra! If *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* are with a searching investigation it is called *samādhi* with investigation and consideration. If *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* are with an analytical consideration it is called *samādhi* without investigation and only consideration. If *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* are upon the conditionally unified *dharma* it is called *Samādhi* without investigation or consideration.”    **

慈氏菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！云何止相？云何舉相？云何捨相？」

Maitreya Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! What is the characteristic of ‘stopping’? What is the characteristic of arousal (’going’, rising up)? What is the characteristic of relinquishment?

佛告慈氏菩薩曰：「善男子！若心掉舉或恐掉舉時，諸可厭法作意及彼無間心作意，是名止相。若心沈沒或恐沈沒時，諸可欣法作意及彼心相作意，是名舉相。若於一向止道，或於一向觀道，或於雙運轉道，二隨煩惱所染污時，諸無功用作意，及心任運轉中所有作意，是名捨相。」

The Buddha replied to Maitreya Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! When the mind is unsettled or afraid of becoming unsettled, bringing undesirable things to mind and then bringing about that uninterrupted mind, this is called the characteristic of stopping. When the mind is sunken or afraid of becoming sunken, bringing joyful things to mind and then bringing about that characteristic of mind, this is called the characteristic of arousal. When headed on the path of stopping, or headed on the path of ‘seeing’, or the path of evolving both together, if the defilement of these two afflictions should follow along, bringing about effortlessness to mind and then bringing about a mind from within the spontaneous operation of mind, this is called the characteristic of relinquishment.



慈氏菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！修奢摩他、毘鉢舍那諸菩薩眾，知法知義。云何知法？云何知義？」

Maitreya Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! All those bodhisattvas who practice *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* know both Dharma and [its] meaning (*artha*). What is knowing Dharma? What is knowing meaning?”

### Knowing All Dharma

佛告慈氏菩薩曰：「善男子！彼諸菩薩，由五種相了知於法：一者、知名；二者、知句；三者、知文；四者、知別；五者知總。云何為名？謂於一切染淨法中，所立自性想假施設。云何為句？謂即於彼名聚集中，能隨宣說諸染淨義，依持建立。云何為文？謂即彼二所依止字。云何於彼各別了知？謂由各別所緣作意。云何於彼總合了知？謂由總合所緣作意。如是一切總略為一，名為知法。如是名為菩薩知法。

The Buddha replied to Maitreya Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! All those bodhisattvas understand Dharma by five kinds of characteristics: 1. knowing names (words); 2. knowing phrases (sentences); 3. knowing writing; 4. knowing differences; 5. knowing unity. What are names? They are the provisional perceptual designations that establish inherent nature among all defiled and purified dharmas. What are phrases? They are then the gathering together of those names and the ability to use them in discourse to explain the foundational basis of the meaning of ‘defiled’ and ‘pure’. What is writing? It is then the putting into characters (letters, symbols) those two (names and phrases). What is it to understand the differences of each of these? It is brining to mind each different one as a condition. What is it to understand that as a unity? It is from bringing to mind the condition of its unification. Everything unified into one like this is called knowing Dharma. Like this, it is called a bodhisattva knowing Dharma.”

### Knowing All Meaning

「善男子！彼諸菩薩，由十種相了知於義：一者、知盡所有性；二者、知如所有性；三者、知能取義；四者、知所取義；五者、知建立義；六者、知受用義；七者、知顛倒義；八者、知無倒義；九者、知雜染義；十者、知清淨義。

“Kulaputra! All those bodhisattvas understand Meaning (*ārtha*) by ten kind of characteristics: 1. they know the limit of existent nature. 2. they know the suchness of existent nature. 3. they know the meaning of subject. 4. they know the meaning of object. 5. they know the meaning of construct (*pratiṣṭhā*). 6. they know the meaning of enjoyment (*saṃbhoga*). 7. they know the meaning of inversion (*viparyaya*). 8. they know the meaning of not being inverted. 9. they know the meaning of defilement (*kaṣāya*). 10. they know the meaning of purification (*viśuddhi*).”

「善男子！盡所有性者，謂諸雜染清淨法中，所有一切品別邊際，是名此中盡所有性。如五數蘊、六數內處、六數外處，如是一切。

“Kulaputra! 1. The limit of existent nature is the limit to the differentiating analysis of all that exists among all defiled and purified *dharmas*. Within what is called the limit of existent nature, there are such things as the five aggregates, the six internal bases, the six external bases, everything like this.”

「如所有性者，謂即一切染淨法中，所有真如，是名此中如所有性。此復七種：一者、流轉真如，謂一切行無先後性；二者、相真如，謂一切法、補特伽羅無我性及法無我性；三者、了別真如，謂一切行唯是識性；四者、安立真如，謂我所說諸苦聖諦；五者、邪行真如，謂我所說諸集聖諦；六者、清淨真如，謂我所說諸滅聖諦；七者、正行真如，謂我所說諸道聖諦。當知此中由流轉真如、安立真如、邪行真如故，一切有情平等平等。由相真如、了別真如故，一切諸法平等平等。由清淨真如故，一切聲聞菩提、獨覺菩提、阿耨多羅三藐三菩提，平等平等。由正行真如故，聽聞正法，緣總境界勝奢摩他、毘鉢舍那所攝受慧，平等平等。

### The Seven Suchnesses

2. “The suchness of existent nature is there then being *bhūtatathatā* (True Suchness) among all defiled and purified dharmas. Within what is called the suchness of existent nature there are these seven kinds: 1. The True Suchness of transmigration (*saṃsāra*), which is that all conditionings (*saṃskāra*) are without the nature of before or after; 2. The True Suchness of characteristics (*lakṣana*), which is the self-less nature of the *pudgala* and the self-less nature of all *dharmas;* 3. The True Suchness of discernment, which is all conditionings being of the nature of ‘consciousness-only’; 4. The True Suchness of the firmly established (*supratiṣṭhita*), which is the Noble Truth of suffering I have explained; 5. The True Suchness of erroneous action, which is the Noble Truth of the accumulation of suffering I have explained; 6. The True Suchness of purification, which is the Noble Truth of the cessation I have explained; 7. The True Suchness of correct action, which is the Noble Truth of the Path I have explained. You should know, within this, due to the True Suchness of transmigration, the True Suchness of the firmly established, and the True Suchness of erroneous action, all sentient beings and entirely equal. Due to the True Suchness of characteristics and the True Suchness of discernment, all dharmas are entirely equal. And due to the Ture Suchness of purification, the awakening (*bodhi*) of voice hearers, the awakening of the solitary enlightened, the *anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi* are entirely equal. Due to the True Suchness of correct action, the Correct Dharma that has been heard and the wisdom received and embraced in the unified realm of *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* are entirely equal.”

「能取義者，謂內五色處、若心、意、識及諸心法。

“3. The meaning of subject is the five internal sense bases and, there being mind, thought, and consciousness then there are all the dharmas of mind.”

「所取義者，謂外六處。又能取義，亦所取義。

“4. The meaning of object is the six external sense bases, as well as the meaning of subject and the meaning of object.”

「建立義者，謂器世界，於中可得建立一切諸有情界。謂一村田、若百村田、若千村田、若百千村田。或一大地至海邊際，此百、此千、若此百千。或一贍部洲，此百、此千、若此百千。或一四大洲，此百、此千、若此百千。或一小千世界，此百、此千、若此百千。或一中千世界，此百、此千、若此百千。或一三千大千世界，此百、此千、若此百千。或此拘胝、此百拘胝、此千拘胝、此百千拘胝。或此無數、此百無數、此千無數、此百千無數、或三千大千世界無數、百千微塵量等，於十方面無量無數諸器世界。

“5. The meaning of construct (or structure, *pratiṣṭhā*) is the world as a device, upon which are constructed the realms of sentient beings, whether it be a single village, or a hundred villages, or a thousand villages, or a hundred thousand villages; whether a single great land bordering the ocean, or a hundred, or a thousand, or a hundred thousand; Or a single Jumbud continent, or a hundred, or a thousand, or a hundred thousand; whether a single Four Great Continents, or a hundred, or a thousand, or a hundred thousand; whether a single small world-system, or a hundred, or a thousand, or a hundred thousand; whether a single medium world-system, or a hundred, or a thousand, or a hundred thousand; whether a single Three Thousand Great Thousand world-system, or a hundred, or a thousand, or a hundred thousand; or whether a *koṭī*, a hundred *koṭī*, a hunred thousand *koṭī*; or an immeasurable amount, or a hundred immeasurables, or a thousand immeasurables, or a hundred thousand immeasurables; or whether an amount equal to all the immeasurable hundreds of thousands of minute particles in Three Thousand Great Thousand world-systems throughout the Ten Directions, encompassing immeasurable, incalculable worlds as devices.”

「受用義者，謂我所說諸有情類，為受用故，攝受資具。

“6. The meaning of enjoyment (*saṃbhoga*) is the embracing all the necessities for all kinds of sentient beings to receive enjoyment as I have explained.

「顛倒義者，謂即於彼能取等義，無常計常，想倒、心倒、見倒。苦計為樂，不淨計淨，無我計我，想倒、心倒、見倒。

“7. The meaning of inversion (*viparyaya*) is also the meaning of that subject, [object] taking the impermanent to be permanent, perceiving inverted, mind inverted mind, seeing (or view) inverted; taking suffering to be pleasure; the impure to be pure; and that which is without self for self, perceiving inverted, mind inverted, seeing (or view) inverted.”

「無倒義者，與上相違。能對治彼，應知其相。

“8. The meaning of not being inverted is not being with the characteristics of the above. To be able to stand against them, one must know their characteristics.”

「雜染義者，謂三界中三種雜染：一者、煩惱雜染；二者、業雜染；三者、生雜染。

“9. The meaning of defilement (*kaṣāya*) is the three kinds of defilement within the Triple Realm: 1. Defilement of afflictions; 2. Defilement of karma; 3. Defilement of birth.”

「清淨義者，謂即如是三種雜染，所有離繫菩提分法。

“10. The meaning of purification (*viśuddhi*) is the dharma of the factors of awakening, which are able to transcend those three kinds of defilement.”

「善男子！如是十種，當知普攝一切諸義。

“Kulaputra! These ten kinds, you should know, encompass all meaning.”

「復次，善男子！彼諸菩薩，由能了知五種義故，名為知義。何等五義？一者、遍知事；二者、遍知義；三者、遍知因；四者、得遍知果；五者、於此覺了。

“Furthermore, kulaputra! All those bodhisattvas, because they are able to understand five kinds [types, or even ‘seeds’) of meaning, are said to know meaning. What are the five meanings? 1. All- pervasive knowledge of matters; 2. All-pervasive knowledge of meanings; 3. All-pervasive knowledge of causes; 4. All-pervasive knowledge of results; 5. fully awakened knowledge of all this.”

「善男子！此中遍知事者，當知即是一切所知：謂或諸蘊，或諸內處或諸外處；如是一切。

“Kulaputra! 1. The all-pervasive knowledge of matters herein, you should know, refers to knowledge of all that is knowable: such as all of the aggregates, all of the internal sense bases, the external sense bases, like this, everything.”

「遍知義者，乃至所有品類差別所應知境。謂世俗故、或勝義故，或功德故、或過失故，緣故，世故，或生、或住、或壞相故，或如病等故，或苦集等故，或真如、實際、法界等故，或廣略故，或一向記故、或分別記故、或反問記故、或置記故，或隱密故、或顯了故：如是等類，當知一切名遍知義。

“2. All-pervasive knowledge of meaning is the state of knowledge of all the different varieties and differentiations there are to be known: whether worldly conventions or the ultimate meaning, or of virtues, or of faults, or of the conditioned, or of time, or of arising, or of abiding, or of the characteristic of passing away, or of things like illness, or of the accumulation of suffering, etc., or of the True Suchness Reality of the equality of the Dharmadhatu, or of the general or the specific, or of a direct answer, or of a differentiating answer, or of a questioning in return answer, or of an avoiding answer, or of the occulted (hidden, secret, mysterious), or of the revealed; all such varieties as these, you should know, are what is called all-pervasive knowledge of meaning.”

「言遍知因者，當知即是能取前二菩提分法，所謂念住或正斷等。

“3. To speak of all-pervasive knowledge of causes, you should know, refers to the mindful abiding and correct severance, etc.. which are what enable the comprehension of the previous two factors of awakening (*bodhi*).”

「得遍知果者，謂貪、恚、癡永斷毘奈耶，及貪、恚、癡一切永斷諸沙門果。及我所說聲聞、如來若共不共世出世間所有功德，於彼作證。

“4. All-pervasive knowledge of results refers to the realization of the *Vinaya* (’discipline’) that forever severs greed, hatred, and delusion, and the results of all *śramaṇa*’s eternal severance of all greed, hatred, and delusion, and, all common and extraordinary, worldly and transcendent virtuous of the Thus Come One that I have explained to the voice hearers”

「於此覺了者，謂即於此作證法中，諸解脫智，廣為他說、宣揚、開示。

“5. Fully awakened knowledge of all this refers to extensively explaining all the liberated knowledge of the realization of this Dharma to others, spreading it about and demonstrating.”

「善男子！如是五義，當知普攝一切諸義。

“Kulaputra! These five meanings, you should know, encompass all meanings.”

「復次，善男子！彼諸菩薩，由能了知四種義故，名為知義。何等四義？一者、心執受義；二者、領納義；三者、了別義；四者、雜染清淨義。善男子！如是四義，當知普攝一切諸義。

“Furthermore, Kulaputra! Those bodhisattvas are said to know meaning because they are able to understand four kinds of meaning: What four meanings? First, the meaning of mental grasping; second, the meaning of experience; third, the meaning of differentiation (*vikalpa*); and fourth, the meaning of defilement and purity. Kulaputra! You should know, these four meanings encompass all meaning.

「復次，善男子！彼諸菩薩，由能了知三種義故，名為知義。何等三義？一者、文義；二者、義義；三者、界義。

“Furthermore, kulaputra! Those bodhisattvas are said to know meaning because they are able to understand three kinds of meaning. What three meanings? First, the meaning of expressions; second, the meaning of meaning; third, the meaning of realms (*dhātu*).”

「善男子！言文義者，謂名身等。

“Kulaputra! The meaning of spoken expressions is what is called the body, etc.

「義義當知復有十種：一者、真實相；二者、遍知相；三者、永斷相；四者、作證相；五者、修習相；六者、即彼真實相等品差別相；七者、所依能依相屬相；八者、即遍知等障礙法相；九者、即彼隨順法相；十者、不遍知等及遍知等過患功德相。

“The meaning of meaning, you should know, also had ten types: 1. The Characteristic of True Suchness (*bhūtatathatā-lakṣana*); 2. the characteristic of all-pervasive knowledge; 3. the characteristic of eternal severance; 4. the characteristic of realization; 5. the characteristic of cultivation, 6. the characteristic of those things (#2-5) differentiated from the Characteristic of True Suchness; 7. the characteristic of the interdependence between whatever are characterized as support and the supported; 8. the characteristic of being an obstruction to the Dharma of all-pervasive knowledge, etc.; 9. the characteristic of that which is in accord with those Dharma; and 10. the characteristic of the faults of there not being all-pervasive knowledge, etc., and virtues of there being all-pervasive knowledge, etc.”

「言界義者，謂五種界：一者、器世界；二者、有情界；三者、法界；四者、所調伏界；五者、調伏方便界。

“The meaning of what are called realms is of five kinds of realms: 1. the realm of the material world; 2. the realm of sentient beings; 3. the Dharma Realm; 4. the realm of discipline; 5. the realm of disciplinary upaya.”

「善男子！如是五義，當知普攝一切諸義。」

‘Kulaputra! These five meanings, you should know, encompass all meaning.”

慈氏菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！若聞所成慧了知其義，若思所成慧了知其義，若奢摩他、毘鉢舍那修所成慧了知其義，此何差別？」

Maitreya Bodhisattva further addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! What is the difference between the intelligence gained by understanding meaning through hearing, the intelligence gained by understanding meaning through contemplation, and the intelligence gained by understanding meaning through *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā?”*

佛告慈氏菩薩曰：「善男子！聞所成慧，依止於文，但如其說，未善意趣，未現在前，隨順解脫，未能領受成解脫義。思所成慧，亦依於文，不唯如說，能善意趣，未現在前，轉順解脫，未能領受成解脫義。若諸菩薩修所成慧，亦依於文亦不依文，亦如其說亦不如說，能善意趣，所知事同分三摩地所行影像現前，極順解脫，已能領受成解脫義。善男子！是名三種知義差別。」

The Buddha replied to Maitreya saying, “Kulaputra! Intelligence gained from hearing relies and rests upon expressions, it is only as has been explained; never arriving at a Good Mind, never having it appear forefront; headed for liberation, yet not yet able to achieve the meaning of Liberation.”

“Intelligence gained from contemplation also relies upon expressions, but is not only as has been explained; able to arrive at a Good Mind, yet not yet appearing forefront; (r)evolving toward liberation, yet not yet able to achieve the meaning of Liberation.”

“Intelligence gained from the cultivation of bodhisattvas also relies upon expressions, yet also does not rely upon expressions; is as has been explained, and also not as has been explained; able to arrive at a Good Mind, whatever there is to be known or created appears forefront as images in the practice of *samādhi*, ultimately conforming to liberation and able to take in the meaning of and gain Liberation. Kulaputra! These are called the three different types of knowledge of means.”

慈氏菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！修奢摩他、毘鉢舍那諸菩薩眾，知法知義，云何為智？云何為見？」

Maitreya Bodhisattva again addresses the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! What is Wisdom and what is seeing (vision, insight, view) of all those bodhisattvas who know Dharma and its meaning through their cultivation of *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā*?”

佛告慈氏菩薩曰：「善男子！我無量門宣說智、見二種差別，今當為汝略說其相。若緣總法修奢摩他、毘鉢舍那所有妙慧，是名為智；若緣別法修奢摩他、毘鉢舍那所有妙慧，是名為見。」

The Buddha replied to Maitreya Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! I have explained the differentiations of Wisdom and seeing in innumerable ways, I will now tell you about their characteristics in general. If one cultivates *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* focused on the Dharma as a unified whole, the subtle intellect therein is called Wisdom. If one cultivates *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* focused on differentiated Dharma, the subtle intellect therein is called seeing.”

慈氏菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！修奢摩他、毘鉢舍那諸菩薩眾由何，作意何等？云何除遣諸相？」

Maitreya again addressed the Buddha saying, ‘World-Honored One! What is the mind of a bodhisattva like in *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* and how is it done? How are all characteristics removed?”

佛告慈氏菩薩曰：「善男子！由真如作意，除遣法相及與義相；若於其名及名自性無所得時，亦不觀彼所依之相，如是除遣。如於其名，於句、於文、於一切義，當知亦爾。乃至於界及界自性無所得時，亦不觀彼所依之相，如是除遣。」

The Buddha replied to Maitreya saying, “Kulaputra! By the mind of True Suchness, the characteristics of *dharmas* as well as the characteristic of meaning (’significance’) are removed. When there in nothing to be attained in names and in the self-nature of names, there is also no observing the characteristics upon which they are based, thus they are removed. As with names, also with sentences and expressions, toward all meaning, you should know, is also like this. When there is nothing to be attained in any realm or self-nature of realms, there is also no observing the characteristics upon which they are based, thus they are removed.”

「世尊！諸所了知真如義相，此真如相亦可遣不？」

“World-honored One! What about the Characteristic of True Suchness understood; is the Characteristic of True Suchness also to be removed, or not?”

「善男子！於所了知真如義中，都無有相，亦無所得，當何所遣？善男子！我說了知真如義時，能伏一切法義之相，非此了達餘所能伏。」

“Kulaputra! Within the understanding of the meaning of True Suchness, there are no characteristics and there is also nothing to attain, how could there be anything to remove? Kulaputra! When I explain[ed] the meaning of understanding True Suchness, it is able to control the characteristics of the meaning of all things, yet it is not that this discernment is something further to be controlled.”

「世尊！如世尊說，濁水器喻、不淨鏡喻、撓泉池喻，不任觀察自面影相；若堪任者，與上相違。如是若有不善修心，則不堪任如實觀察所有真如；若善修心，堪任觀察。此說何等能觀察心？依何真如而作是說？」

“World-Honored One! As the World-Honored One has explained using the analogy of the bowl of turbid water, the analogy of the unclean mirror, and the analogy of the bubbling spring, that they cannot sustain investigation (*pravicaya*) of the characteristic features of one’s own face. The opposite of these then sustain the characteristics. Like this, if the mind is not well cultivated, then it will not be able to sustain real investigation of True Suchness. If the mind is well cultivated, it sustains investigation. In this explanation, what is able to investigate mind? Upon what True Suchness is this explanation based?"

「善男子！此說三種能觀察心，謂聞所成能觀察心，若思所成能觀察心，若修所成能觀察心。依了別真如作如是說。」

“Kulaputra! These explanations speak of three kinds of ability to investigate mind (*pravicaya*): gaining the ability to investigate mind by learning (’hearing’), gaining the ability to investigate mind by pondering, and gaining the ability to investigate mind by cultivation. Explanations like this are based upon True Suchness differentiated like this.”

「世尊！如是了知法義菩薩為遣諸相勤修加行，有幾種相難可除遣？誰能除遣？」

“World-Honored One! Completely understanding the meaning of Dharma and Meaning like this, bodhisattvas earnestly cultivate practices of getting rid of all characteristics. How many kind of characteristics are hard to get rid of? Who can get rid of them?”

「善男子！有十種相，空能除遣。何等為十？一者、了知法義故，有種種文字相；此由一切法空，能正除遣。二者、了知安立真如義故，有生、滅、住、異性相續隨轉相；此由相空及無先後空，能正除遣。三者、了知能取義故，有顧戀身相及我慢相；此由內空及無所得空，能正除遣。四者、了知所取義故，有顧戀財相；此由外空，能正除遣。五者、了知受用義、男女承事資具相應故，有內安樂相、外淨妙相；此由內外空及本性空，能正除遣。六者、了知建立義故，有無量相；此由大空，能正除遣。七者、了知無色故，有內寂靜解脫相；此由有為空，能正除遣。八者、了知相真如義故，有補特伽羅無我相、法無我相，若唯識相及勝義相；此由畢竟空、無性空、無性自性空及勝義空，能正除遣。九者、由了知清淨真如義故，有無為相、無變異相；此由無為空、無變異空，能正除遣。十者、即於彼相對治空性，作意思惟故，有空性相；此由空空，能正除遣。」

“Kulaputra! There are ten kinds of characteristics, which emptiness is able to get rid of. What ten? 1. Since they completely understand all ‘Dharma’ and ‘Meaning’, there are the characteristics of all kinds of expressions and words, which are correctly gotten rid of because all *dharmas* are empty; 2. Since they completely understand the meaning of the establishment of True Suchness, there are the characteristics of arising, ceasing, abiding, and different natures, and the characteristics of continuous succession, which are correctly gotten rid of because all characteristics are empty, and are also without before or after; 3. Since they completely understand the meaning of subject (lit. ‘that which is able to grasp’), there are the characteristics of loving the body and the characteristic of self conceit, which are correctly gotten rid of because internality is empty, and the emptiness of there not being anything to attain; 4. Since they completely understand the meaning of object (lit. ‘that which is grasped’), there are the characteristics of loving possessions, which are correctly gotten rid of because of the emptiness of externality; 5. Completely understanding the meaning of enjoyment, since men and women flirt with the characteristics of their endowments, there are the characteristics of internal pleasure and the characteristics of external charm, which are correctly gotten rid of because of the emptiness of internality and externality, and the emptiness of original nature; 6. Completely understanding the meaning of constructs (asserations), there are immeasurable characteristics, which are correctly gotten rid of because of the emptiness of greatness; 7. Completely understanding the meaning of formlessness, there are the characteristics of inner tranquility and liberation, which are correctly gotten rid of because of the emptiness of the conditioned; 8. Since they completely understand the meaning of the True Suchness of characteristics, there are the characteristics of selfless *pudgala*s and the characteristic of the selflessness of *dharmas*, whether characteristics solely of the consciousness or the Characteristic of Ultimate Meaning, which are correctly gotten rid of because of the emptiness of finality, the emptiness of naturelessness, the emptiness of the self-nature of naturelessness, and the emptiness of Ultimate Meaning; 9. Since they completely understand the meaning of the purity of True Suchness, there is the characteristic of the unconditioned and the characteristic of changlessness, which are correctly gotten rid of because of the emptiness of the unconditioned and the emptiness of changlessness; and 10. Since they have these thoughts from the empty nature of those ridded characteristics, there is the characteristic of the nature of emptiness, which is correctly gotten rid of because of the emptiness of emptiness.

「世尊！除遣如是十種相時，除遣何等？從何等相而得解脫？」

“World-Honored One! When these ten types of characteristics are gotten rid of, what more is there to get rid of? From what other characteristics is liberation attained?”

「善男子！除遣三摩地所行影像相；從雜染縛相而得解脫，彼亦除遣。善男子！當知就勝說，如是空治如是相，非不一一治一切相。譬如無明，非不能生乃至老死諸雜染法。就勝但說能生於行，由是諸行親近緣故。此中道理，當知亦爾。」

“Kulaputra! Getting rid of all the characteristics of the images that arise from the practice of *samādhi*; from the bonds of defiled characteristics is liberation attained. Kulaputra! You should know, ultimately speaking, emptiness like this governs all characteristics, and it is not that each one governs each of those characteristics ’one-for-one’. Just like ignorance, it is not that it is not able to give rise to all the other defiled dharmas up to old-age and death. Ultimately, however, it is explained as that which is able to give rise to conditioning (*saṃskāra*), since it is the immediate causal condition of all conditioning. And the Truth within this, you should know, is also so.”

爾時，慈氏菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！此中何等空是總空性相？若諸菩薩了知是已，無有失壞於空性相，離增上慢？」

At that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! What kind of emptiness is within that unified characteristic of the nature of emptiness if bodhisattvas have fully understood this, without an erroneous decaying sense of the characteristic of the nature of emptiness, and are free of prideful conceit?”

爾時，世尊歎慈氏菩薩曰：「善哉，善哉！善男子！汝今乃能請問如來如是深義，令諸菩薩於空性相無有失壞。何以故？善男子！若諸菩薩於空性相有失壞者，便為失壞一切大乘。是故汝應諦聽，諦聽！當為汝說總空性相。善男子！若於依他起相及圓成實相中，一切品類雜染、清淨遍計所執相，畢竟遠離性，及於此中都無所得，如是名為於大乘中總空性相。」

At that time, the World-Honored One praised Maitreya Bodhisattva saying, “Excellent! Excellent! Kulaputra! You have now been able to ask the Thus Come One about such profound meaning, causing bodhisattvas not to have an erroneous decaying sense of the characteristic of the nature of emptiness. Why? Kulaputra! If bodhisattvas have have an erroneous decaying sense of the characteristic of the nature of emptiness then they will be erroneous about and decay the entire Great Vehicle. For this reason, you should listen attentively, listen attentively! I will explain the unified characteristic of the nature of emptiness. Kulaputra! Among the characteristic of arising in dependence upon another and the characteristic of complete, perfect reality, if all the varieties of defiled and pure imaginary characteristics are completely free of natures and, within this, there is nothing to be attained, like this, this is called the unified characteristic of the nature of emptiness within the Great Vehicle.”

慈氏菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！此奢摩他、毘鉢舍那，能攝幾種勝三摩地？」

Maitreya Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! How many kinds of superior *samādhis* is this *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* able to harmonize (embrace, includes)?”

佛告慈氏菩薩曰：「善男子！如我所說無量聲聞、菩薩、如來，有無量種勝三摩地，當知一切皆此所攝。」

The Buddha replied to Maitreya Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! As I have explained, the immeasurable Voice Hearers, Bodhisattvas, and Thus Come Ones have immeasurable kinds of superior *samādhis*, you should know, each one harmonizes all of these.”

「世尊！此奢摩他、毘鉢舍那以何為因？」

“World-Honored One! What is the cause of this *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā*?”

「善男子！清淨尸羅，清淨聞思所成正見，以為其因。」

“Kulaputra! Pure śīla and Right View developed from pure ‘hearing and pondering’ (*śruta-cintā*) are the cause.”

「世尊！此奢摩他、毘鉢舍那以何為果？」

“World-Honored One! “What is the result (’fruit’) of this *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā*?”

「善男子！善清淨戒、清淨心、善清淨慧，以為其果。復次，善男子！一切聲聞及如來等，所有世間及出世間一切善法，當知皆是此奢摩他、毘鉢舍那所得之果。」

“Kulaputra! Excellent pure discipline and pure mind, and excellent pure wisdom are the results. Furthermore, Kulaputra! All the excellent Dharma of every Voice Hearer and Thus Come One, etc,, worldly and transcendent, you should know, they are all the ‘fruit attained’ (result) of this *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā*.”

「世尊！此奢摩他、毘鉢舍那能作何業？」

“World-Honored One! What karma is this *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* able to create?”

「善男子！此能解脫二縛為業，所謂相縛及麁重縛。」

“Kulaputra! It is able to liberate from two bonds of karma, the bonds of characteristics and the bonds of ‘gross, coarse heaviness’  [*sthūla* and *lakṣaṇa bandha*, see Ch. 2].”

「世尊！如佛所說五種繫中，幾是奢摩他障？幾是毘鉢舍那障？幾是俱障？」

“World-Honored One! As the Buddha has explained, among the five kinds of entanglements (*vibandha*), how many are obstructions to *śamatha*, how many are obstructions to *vipaśyanā*, and how many are obstructions to both?”

「善男子！顧戀身財，是奢摩他障；於諸聖教不得隨欲，是毘鉢舍那障；樂相雜住，於少喜足，當知俱障。由第一故，不能造修；由第二故，所修加行不到究竟。」

“Kulaputra! Lust for bodies and possessions is an obstruction to *śamatha*. Lack of interest in the Noble Teachings is an obstruction to *vipaśyanā*. Abiding in the turbulence of pleasurable images and being content with shallowness are, you should know, obstructions to both together. Due to the first of these, one is unable to cultivate; due to the second, any practice cultivated will not reach completion.”

「世尊！於五蓋中，幾是奢摩他障？幾是毘鉢舍那障？幾是俱障？」

“World-Honored One! Of the five ‘coverings’ (*nīvaraṇa*), how many are obstructions to *śamatha* , how many are obstructions to *vipaśyanā*, and how many are obstructions to both?”

「善男子！掉舉、惡作，是奢摩他障；惛沈、睡眠、疑，是毘鉢舍那障；貪欲、瞋恚，當知俱障。」

“Kulaputra! Restlessness and worry (*auddhatya-kaukritya*) is an obstruction to *śamatha.* Stupification and laziness (*thīna*-*middha*), and doubt (*vicikitsā*) are obstacles to *vipaśyanā*. Desirousness (*kāmacchanda*) and anger and resentment (*vyāpāda*), you should know, are obstacles to both.”

「世尊！齊何名得奢摩他道圓滿清淨？」

“World-Honored One! What can be called attainment of the fulfillment of purity of the path of *śamatha*?”

「善男子！乃至所有惛沈、睡眠正善除遣，齊是名得奢摩他道圓滿清淨。」

“Kulaputra! When whatever stupefication and laziness there is has been correctly gotten rid of, then this is called attaining the fulfillment of purity of the path of *śamatha.*

「世尊！齊何名得毘鉢舍那道圓滿清淨？」

“World-Honored One! What can be called attainment of the fulfillment of purity of the path of *vipaśyanā*?”

「善男子！乃至所有掉舉、惡作正善除遣，齊是名得毘鉢舍那道圓滿清淨。」

“Kulaputra! When whatever ambition and regret there is has been correctly gotten rid of, then this is called attaining the fulfillment of purity of the path of *vipaśyanā*.”

「世尊！若諸菩薩於奢摩他、毘鉢舍那現在前時，應知幾種心散動法？」

“World-Honored One! When bodhisattvas appear in this *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā,* how many different kinds of mental distractions (*vikṣepa*) should they know about?”

「善男子！應知五種：一者、作意散動；二者、外心散動；三者、內心散動；四者、相散動；五者、麁重散動。善男子！若諸菩薩捨於大乘相應作意，墮在聲聞、獨覺相應諸作意中，當知是名作意散動。若於其外五種妙欲諸雜亂相，所有尋思隨煩惱中，及於其外所緣境中，縱心流散，當知是名外心散動。若由惛沈及以睡眠，或由沈沒，或由愛味三摩鉢底，或由隨一三摩鉢底諸隨煩惱之所染污，當知是名內心散動。若依外相，於內等持所行諸相，作意思惟，名相散動。若內作意為緣，生起所有諸受，由麁重身計我起慢，當知是名麁重散動。」

“Kulaputra! They should know there are five kinds: 1. Distractions of mental attention; 2. Distractions from outside the mind (*citta*); 3. Distractions from inside the mind; 4. Distractions of characteristics; 5. Distractions of ‘Coarse Heaviness’.

Kulaputra! If a bodhisattva relinquishes attending to what is appropriate to the Great Vehicle and falls into attending to everything appropriate to voice hearers or the solitary enlightened, you should know, this is called distractions of mental attention. If one’s mind becomes scattered among all the inverting characteristics of the five kinds of wonderous external desires, vexations accompanying thoughts pursuing external objects, you should know, this is called distraction from outside the mind. If one is stupefied by laziness, or in oblivion, or in love with the taste of *samāpatti* (attainments), or defiled by the accompanying passion for a particular *samāpatti*, you should know, this is called distractions from inside the mind. If one is dependent upon external characteristics  (images) when contemplating internally all the characteristics of [their] conditioning, this is distraction by characteristics. If internally one attends to sensations that arise conditionally and yet, because of the coarse heaviness of the body, imagines a self and engenders pride, you should know, this is called Distractions of ‘Coarse Heaviness’.”  **

「世尊！此奢摩他、毘鉢舍那，從初菩薩地乃至如來地，能對治何障？」

“World-Honored One! This *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā*, **from the initial bodhisattva stage up to the stage of Thus Come One, what obstructions are they able to counteract?”

「善男子！此奢摩他、毘鉢舍那，於初地中，對治惡趣煩惱業生雜染障。第二地中，對治微細誤犯現行障。第三地中，對治欲貪障。第四地中，對治定愛及法愛障。第五地中，對治生死涅槃一向背趣障。第六地中，對治相多現行障。第七地中，對治細相現行障。第八地中，對治於無相作功用及於有相不得自在障。第九地中，對治於一切種善巧言辭不得自在障。第十地中，對治不得圓滿法身證得障。善男子！此奢摩他、毘鉢舍那，於如來地，對治極微細最極微細煩惱障及所知障。由能永害如是障故，究竟證得無著無礙一切智見。依於所作成滿所緣，建立最極清淨法身。」

“Kulaputra! This *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā*, in the initial bodhisattva stage, counteracts the obstruction of afflicted karma that leads to evil destinies and the arising of defilement. In the second stage, the obstruction of the appearance of subtle transgressions is counteracted. In the third stage, the obstruction of craving is counteracted. In the fourth stage, the obstruction of the love of meditation and even love of the Dharma is counteracted. In the fifth stage, the obstruction of being singularly focused on rejecting birth & death for Nirvana is counteracted. In the sixth stage, the obstruction of the appearance of gross characteristics is counteracted. In the seventh stage, the obstruction of the appearance of subtle characteristics is counteracted. In the eighth stage, the obstruction of not having attained mastery of the usefulness of characteristiclessness and the unattainability of characteristics is counteracted. In the ninth stage, the obstruction of not having attained mastery of all the various kinds of skillful speech and diction is counteracted. In the tenth stage, the obstruction of not having attained realization of the perfect Dharma Body is counteracted. Kulaputra! This *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā*, in the stage of a Thus Come One, counteracts the obstruction of the most subtle affliction and the obstruction to the knowable. Since they are thus able to completely eradicate these obstructions, they ultimately realize unattached and unhindered All-Knowledge. Based upon the conditions of this accomplishment of [their] objective, they are installed in the ultimately pure Dharma Body.”

慈氏菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！云何菩薩依奢摩他、毘鉢舍那勤修行故，證得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提？」

Maitreya Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, ‘World-Honored One! How is that bodhisattvas cultivating practice based upon this *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* realize attainment of *anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi*?”

佛告慈氏菩薩曰：「善男子！若諸菩薩已得奢摩他、毘鉢舍那，依七真如，於如所聞所思法中，由勝定心，於善審定、於善思量、於善安立真如性中，內正思惟。彼於真如正思惟故，心於一切細相現行尚能棄捨，何況麁相？善男子！言細相者，謂心所執受相，或領納相，或了別相，或雜染清淨相，或內相，或外相，或內外相，或謂我當修行一切利有情相，或正智相，或真如相，或苦集滅道相，或有為相，或無為相，或有常相，或無常相，或苦有變異性相，或苦無變異性相，或有為異相相，或有為同相相，或知一切是一切已有一切相，或補特伽羅無我相，或法無我相。於彼現行，心能棄捨。

The Buddha replied to Maitreya Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! If bodhisattvas who have attained *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* rely upon the Seven Suchnesses among all the Dharma they have heard and pondered, then this supremely concentrated mind internally correctly comprehends (*samyak-saṃkalpa*) the nature of True Suchness among everything well considered, well examined, and well established. Due to that correct comprehension of True Suchness, the mind is able to relinquish attachment to the appearance of the most minute characteristics, how much more so the gross? Kulaputra! Minute characteristics are what are called: characteristics appropriated by mind; the characteristic of being experienced; differentiating characteristics; characteristics of purity and defilement; the characteristic of interiority; the characteristic of exteriority; the characteristic of both interiority and exteriority; the characteristic of what is considered the self cultivating practice for the benefit of all sentient beings; the characteristic of Correct Knowledge; the characteristic of True Suchness; the characteristics of suffering, its accumulation, its cessation, and the Path; the characteristic of being conditioned; the characteristic of the unconditioned; the characteristic of being eternal; the characteristic of being impermanent; the characteristic of suffering having a nature transmutable into something different; the characteristic of suffering being without a nature transmutable into something different; the characteristic of the difference between all the characteristics of the conditioned; the characteristic of the similarity between all the characteristics of the conditioned; the characteristic of the knowledge of everything already being everything; the characteristic of a selfless *pudgala;* or the characteristic of Dharma without self. With the appearance of that, the mind is able to relinquish attachment.”

「彼既多住如是行故，於時時間，從其一切繫蓋散動，善修治心。從是已後，於七真如，有七各別自內所證通達智生，名為見道。由得此故，名入菩薩正性離生，生如來家，證得初地，又能受用此地勝德。彼於先時，由得奢摩他、毘鉢舍那故，已得二種所緣，謂有分別影像所緣，及無分別影像所緣。彼於今時得見道故，更證得事邊際所緣。復於後後一切地中，進修修道，即於如是三種所緣作意思惟。譬如有人，以其細楔出於麁楔。如是菩薩，依此以楔出楔方便，遣內相故，一切隨順雜染分相皆悉除遣。相除遣故，麁重亦遣。永害一切相麁重故，漸次於彼後後地中，如煉金法陶煉其心。乃至證得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提，又得所作成滿所緣。

“From persistently abiding in practice like this, in the interim, they well cultivate a controlled mind from all bindings, coverings, distractions and movements. After this, seven individual inner realizations of all-pervasive knowledge arise from the Seven Suchnesses called Seeing the Way. Due to this attainment, they are called bodhisattvas of a nature correctly free of [re]birth, born into the family of Thus Come Ones, attaining realization of the initial stage, and able to experience the magnificent virtues of this stage. When they are in the initial stage, since they have attained *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā*, they have already attained two kinds of ‘objects’ (*ālambana*): objects with different appearances, and also objects without different appearances. And, because they have now attained Seeing the Way, they also realize attainment of the limit of objects. Just like someone who removes a large wedge by means of a small wedge. Like this, these bodhisattvas, relying on the *upāya* of extracting a wedge with a wedge, getting rid of the characteristic of interiority, completely gets rid of all subsequent defiled and differentiated characteristics. Because characteristics are gotten rid of, the ‘coarse heaviness’ is also gotten rid of. Because they forever eliminate the coarse heaviness of all characteristics, during each of the stages onward, the mind is gradually refined, as one refines gold, until they realize attainment of *anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi* and attain the object that goes along with its fulfillment.”

「善男子！如是菩薩於內止觀正修行故，證得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。」

“Kulaputra! Because bodhisattvas cultivate correct practice and correct observation interiorly like this, they realize attainment of *anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi*.”

### The Awesome Virtues of Bodhisattvas

慈氏菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！云何修行引發菩薩廣大威德？」

Maitreya Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! How does one cultivate practice so as to generate the immense, awesome virtue of Bodhisattvas?"

「善男子！若諸菩薩善知六處，便能引發菩薩所有廣大威德：一者、善知心生；二者、善知心住；三者、善知心出；四者、善知心增；五者、善知心減；六者、善知方便。

“Kulaputra! If bodhisattvas are well aware of six bases they will be able to generate the immense, awesome virtue of bodhisattvas. 1. Being well aware of the arising of mind; 2. Being well aware of the abiding of mind; 3. Being well aware of the departure of mind; 4. Being well aware of the increase of mind; 5. Being well aware of the decrease of mind; 6. Being well aware of *upāya*.

「云何善知心生？謂如實知十六行心生起差別，是名善知心生。十六行心生起差別者：一者、不可覺知堅住器識生，謂阿陀那識；二者、種種行相所緣識生，謂頓取一切色等境界分別意識，及頓取內外境界覺受，或頓於一念瞬息須臾，現入多定，見多佛土，見多如來，分別意識；三者、小相所緣識生，謂欲界繫識；四者、大相所緣識生，謂色界繫識；五者、無量相所緣識生，謂空、識、無邊處繫識；六者、微細相所緣識生，謂無所有處繫識；七者、邊際相所緣識生，謂非想非非想處繫識；八者、無相識生，謂出世識及緣滅識；九者、苦俱行識生，謂地獄識；十者、雜受俱行識生，謂欲行識；十一、喜俱行識生，謂初二靜慮識；十二、樂俱行識生，謂第三靜慮識；十三、不苦不樂俱行識生，謂從第四靜慮乃至非想非非想處識；十四、染污俱行識生，謂諸煩惱及隨煩惱相應識；十五、善俱行識生，謂信等相應識；十六、無記俱行識生，謂彼俱不相應識。

“How is one well aware of the arising of mind? It is to have true knowledge of sixteen activities that give rise to mind and bring about differentiation, this is called being well aware of the arising of mind. The sixteen activities that give rise to mind and bring about differentiation are: 1. The arising of the unintelligible, steadily abiding receptacle consciousness, which is the *ādāna* (’appropriating’) consciousness; 2. The arising of a conditional consciousness based upon all kinds of activity and characteristics, which is the differentiating *manas* consciousness that immediately apprehends all the realms of objects of material form, [sounds, scents, etc.], and immediately apprehends internal and external realms, *or* immediately, in a single thought [moment], in the span of a *kṣaṇa*, enters many concentrations, sees many Buddha Lands, and sees many Thus Come Ones; 3. The arising of conditional consciousness from minor characteristics, which is consciousness caught up in the Realm of Desire; 4. The arising of conditional consciousness from major characteristics, which is consciousness caught up in the Realm of Form; 5. The arising of conditional consciousness from immeasurable characteristics, which is consciousness caught up in Emptiness, Consciousness, and bases of limitlessness; 6. The arising of conditional consciousness from minute characteristics, which is consciousness caught up in bases of non-existence; 7. The arising of conditional consciousness from the characteristic of limitation, which is consciousness caught up in the base of niether perception nor non-perception; 8. The arising of consciousness of characteristiclessness, which is transcendent consciousness and the extinction of conditional consciousness; 9. The arising of consciousness active in tandem with suffering, which is consciousness of the Hell Realms; 10. The arising of consciousness active in tandem with the variety of experiences, which is consciousness of actions of desire; 11. The arising of consciousness active in tandem with joy, which is consciousness of the first two meditative states; 12. The arising of consciousness active in tandem with bliss, which is consciousness of the third meditative state; 13. The arising of consciousness active in tandem with neither suffering nor bliss, which is consciousness of the fourth meditative state up to the base of neither perception nor non-perception; 14. The arising of consciousness active in tandem with defilement, which is consciousness that goes along with all the afflictions and characteristics of affiction; 15. The arising of consciousness active in tandem with excellence, which is consciousness associated with faith and other such characteristics; 16. The arising of consciousness active in tandem with neutrality (’no record’), which is consciousness unassociated with either of those [14 or 15].”

「云何善知心住？謂如實知了別真如。

“How is one well aware of the abiding of mind? It is truly knowing differentiating [and] True Suchness.”

「云何善知心出？謂如實知出二種縛：所謂相縛及麁重縛。此能善知，應令其心從如是出。

“How is one well aware of the departure of mind? It is truly knowing departing from the two kinds of bonds: which are the bonds of characteristics and the bonds of coarse heaviness. Being well aware, one thus causes the mind to depart from them.”

「云何善知心增？謂如實知能治相縛、麁重縛心，彼增長時，彼積集時，亦得增長，亦得積集，名善知增。

“How is one well aware of the increase of mind? This is truly knowing the mind that is able to control the bonds of characteristics and the bonds of coarse heaviness, and when they increase and grow, when they gather and accumulate, [that mind] also increases and grows, [it] also gathers and accumulates. This is called being well aware of increasing.”

「云何善知心減？謂如實知彼所對治相，及麁重所雜染心，彼衰退時，彼損減時，此亦衰退，此亦損減，名善知減。

“How is one well aware of the decrease of mind? This is truly knowing the controlling effects of characteristics and the defiling mind (thoughts) of coarse heaviness and, when those recede, when those decrease, this also recedes, this also decreases. This is called being well aware of decreasing.”

「云何善知方便？謂如實知解脫、勝處、及與遍處，或修或遣。

“How is one well aware of *upāya*? This is truly knowing the Liberations, the victorious Bases, up to the Bases of Totality, in cultivation or in dispensation.”

「善男子！如是菩薩，於諸菩薩廣大威德，或已引發、或當引發、或現引發。」

“Kulaputra! Bodhisattvas thus either have generated, will generate, or are presently generating all the immense, awesome virtues of bodhisattvas.”

慈氏菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！如世尊說：『於無餘依涅槃界中，一切諸受無餘永滅。』何等諸受於此永滅？」

Maitreya Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! Have the World-Honored One has said, ‘Abiding within the realm of Nirvana without remainder all sensations are forever extinguished without remainder.’ What are these sensations that are forever extinguished?”

「善男子！以要言之，有二種受無餘永滅。何等為二？一者、所依麁重受；二者、彼果境界受。所依麁重受，當知有四種：一者、有色所依受；二者、無色所依受；三者、果已成滿麁重受；四者、果未成滿麁重受。果已成滿受者，謂現在受。果未成滿受者，謂未來因受。彼果境界受，亦有四種：一者、依持受；二者、資具受；三者、受用受；四者、顧戀受。於有餘依涅槃界中，果未成滿受一切已滅，領彼對治明觸生受，領受共有。或復彼果已成滿受。又二種受，一切已滅。唯現領受，明觸生受。於無餘依涅槃界中般涅槃時，此亦永滅。是故說言於無餘依涅槃界中，一切諸受無餘永滅。」

“Kulaputra! Essentially speaking, there are two types of sensations extinguished forever without remainder. What two? 1. Sensations of abiding in coarse heaviness; 2. Sensations of objects resulting therefrom.”

“Sensations of abiding in coarse heaviness, you should know, are of four types: 1. Sensations of there being [physical] form; 2. Sensations of formlessness; 3. Sensations of the results of coarse heaviness already developed; 4. Sensations of the results of coarse heaviness not yet developed.”

“The results of coarse heaviness already developed are what are presently being experienced (sensed). The results of coarse heaviness not yet developed are the objects of sensation that have not yet arrived.”

“The sensations of the realm of resulting objects is of four types: 1. Sensations of the basis of support; 2. Sensations of requisites; 3. Sensations of a sense of use; 4. Sensations of fondness.”

“Within the realm of Nirvana with remainder, sensations of results not yet fulfilled have all already been extinguished, leading to the sensation that arises from being in contact with wisdom (luminousness), leading to a sensation that is always present. And, those sensations of results already fulfilled are also of two kinds of sensations, all of which are already extinguished: sensations that are just being experienced and sensations arising from being in contact with wisdom. When one is abiding in the *parinirvana* of the Nirvana without remainder, these are also forever extinguished. For this reason it is said that within the Nirvana without remainder all sensations are forever extinguished without remainder.”

爾時，世尊說是語已，復告慈氏菩薩曰：「善哉，善哉！善男子！汝今善能依止圓滿最極清淨妙瑜伽道，請問如來。汝於瑜伽，已得決定，最極善巧。吾已為汝宣說圓滿最極清淨妙瑜伽道，所有一切過去、未來正等覺者，已說、當說皆亦如是。諸善男子、若善女人，皆應依此勇猛精進，當正修學！」

At that time, after the World-Honored One had finished speaking, he further told Maitreya Bodhisattva, “Excellent, excellent! Kulaputra! You now are well able, based upon resting in  fulfillment of the extremely pure wonderous way of Yoga, to inquire of the Thus Come One. You have already definitely attained it with utmost skill. I have already explained to you the fully complete, most utterly pure wonderous way of Yoga, which has been and will be explained by all correctly awakened ones, or will be explained also like this. Kulaputra, sons and good daughters, should all correctly cultivate and study like this, courageously with *virya*!

爾時，世尊欲重宣此義，而說頌曰：

At that time, the World-Honored One, to emphasize his meaning, spoke in verse saying:

於法假立瑜伽中，　　
若行放逸失大義；　
依止此法及瑜伽，　　
若正修行得大覺。

Within the Yoga of provisionally established *dharma*,
If one practices negligently, one loses great benefit;
Based upon Yoga that rests on this Dharma,
If one practices correct cultivation, one attains Great Awakening

見有所得求免離，　　
若謂此見為得法，　
慈氏彼去瑜伽遠，　　
譬如大地與虛空。

Seeing that there is something to attain in the search for escape,
If one says this [way of] seeing is attaining the Dharma,
Maitreya, one is as far from Yoga
As the earth is from the sky.

利生堅固而不作，　　
悟已勤修利有情，　
智者作此窮劫量，　　
便得最上離染喜。

Those who do not work for the benefit and stability of the living,
Once enlightened, are not moved to benefiting sentient beings,
The wise do the work throughout *kalpas*,
And they attain supreme, undefiled joy.

若人為欲而說法，　　
彼名捨欲還取欲，　
愚癡得法無價寶，　　
反更遊行而乞匃。

If someone explains the Dharma out of desire,
That is called relinquishing desire only to grasp desire again.
Fools who attain the priceless jewel of the Dharma,
Yet continue to wander about begging.

於諍諠雜戲論著，　　
應捨發起上精進，　
為度諸天及世間，　　
於此瑜伽汝當學！」

Clinging to argumentation and opinions,
Which they should relinquish, and bring about superior *virya*,
For the liberation of all gods and worldlings,
You should study this Yoga.

爾時，慈氏菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！於是解深密法門中，當何名此教？我當云何奉持？」

At that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! From within this Dharma Door that Reveals the Secret, what should we call this teaching? How should I honor and remember it?”

佛告慈氏菩薩曰：「善男子！此名瑜伽了義之教，於此瑜伽了義之教汝當奉持。」

The Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva, “Kulaputra! This is called the Teaching of the Definitive Meaning of Yoga, as the Teaching of the Definitive Meaning of Yoga is how you should honor and remember it.”

說此瑜伽了義教時，於大會中，有六百千眾生，發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心；三百千聲聞，遠塵離垢，於諸法中，得法眼淨；一百五十千聲聞，諸漏永盡，心得解脫；七十五千菩薩，獲得廣大瑜伽作意。

When this Teaching on the Definitive Meaning of Yoga was explained, six hundred thousand people from among the great assembly generated *anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi-citta*; Three hundred thousand voice-hearers became free from defiling dust and attained purified Dharma Eyes regarding all phenomena (*dharmas*); One hundred fifty thousand voice-hearers ended all their outflows and attained liberated minds; And seventy-five thousand bodhisattvas ‘caught’ attainment of a broad Yoga Mind-State.”
## Chapter 7 - Bhumis and Paramitas

### Questions about the Stages

爾時，觀自在菩薩白佛言：「世尊！如佛所說菩薩十地，所謂極喜地、離垢地、發光地、焰慧地、極難勝地、現前地、遠行地、不動地、善慧地、法雲地；復說佛地為第十一。如是諸地，幾種清淨？幾分所攝？」

At that time, Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! As the Buddha has explained the ten bodhisattva stages as: the stage of Extreme Joy, the stage of Purity, the stage of Refulgence, the stage of Blazing Intellect, the stage of the Difficult to Conquer, the stage of Manifestation, the stage of Gone Afar, the stage of Immovability, the stage of Good Intellect, and the stage of Dharma Cloud. You have further explained the stage of Buddha as an eleventh. The stages being thus, how many purities are there? How many parts do they encompass (*saṃgraha*)”

爾時，世尊告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！當知諸地四種清淨、十一分攝？

At that time, the World-Honored One replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! You should know, the four kinds of purity of the stages, encompassing eleven parts.

「云何名為四種清淨能攝諸地？謂增上意樂清淨攝於初地；增上戒清淨攝第二地；增上心清淨攝第三地；增上慧清淨於後後地轉勝妙故，當知能攝從第四地乃至佛地。善男子！當知如是四種清淨普攝諸地。

“What does it mean to say that the stages encompass four kinds of purity?

1. There is the increasingly superior purity of ‘mind-joy’ (*manobhirāma*) integral to the Initial Stage.

2. There is the increasingly superior purity of moral discipline integral to the Second Stage.

3. There is the increasingly superior purity of Mind integral to the Third Stage.

4. And there is the increasingly superior purity of intellect from the supremely wonderous ‘turning’ of those [previous] stages that, you should know, is integral from the Fourth Stage to the Stage of Buddhahood.

Kulaputra! You should know, these four kinds of purities universally encompass the stages.”

「云何名為十一種分能攝諸地？謂諸菩薩先於勝解行地，依十法行，極善修習勝解忍故，超過彼地，證入菩薩正性離生。彼諸菩薩由是因緣，此分圓滿。而未能於微細毀犯誤現行中正知而行，由是因緣，於此分中猶未圓滿。為令此分得圓滿故，精勤修習便能證得，彼諸菩薩由是因緣，此分圓滿。而未能得世間圓滿、等持、等至及圓滿聞持陀羅尼，由是因緣，於此分中猶未圓滿。為令此分得圓滿故，精勤修習便能證得，彼諸菩薩由是因緣，此分圓滿。而未能令隨所獲得菩提分法，多修習住，心未能捨諸等至愛及與法愛，由是因緣，於此分中猶未圓滿。為令此分得圓滿故，精勤修習便能證得，彼諸菩薩由是因緣，此分圓滿。而未能於諸諦道理如實觀察，又未能於生死涅槃棄捨一向背趣作意，又未能修方便所攝菩提分法，由是因緣，於此分中猶未圓滿。為令此分得圓滿故，精勤修習便能證得，彼諸菩薩由是因緣，此分圓滿。而未能於生死流轉如實觀察，又由於彼多生厭故，未能多住無相作意，由是因緣，於此分中猶未圓滿。為令此分得圓滿故，精勤修習便能證得，彼諸菩薩由是因緣，此分圓滿。而未能令無相作意、無缺、無間、多修習住，由是因緣，於此分中猶未圓滿。為令此分得圓滿故，精勤修習便能證得，彼諸菩薩由是因緣，此分圓滿。而未能於無相住中捨離功用，又未能得於相自在，由是因緣，於此分中猶未圓滿。為令此分得圓滿故，精勤修習便能證得，彼諸菩薩由是因緣，此分圓滿。而未能於異名眾相、訓詞差別、一切品類宣說法中，得大自在，由是因緣，於此分中猶未圓滿。為令此分得圓滿故，精勤修習便能證得，彼諸菩薩由是因緣，此分圓滿。而未能得圓滿法身現前證受，由是因緣，於此分中猶未圓滿。為令此分得圓滿故，精勤修習便能證得，彼諸菩薩由是因緣，此分圓滿。而未能得遍於一切所知境界無著、無礙、妙智、妙見，由是因緣，於此分中猶未圓滿。為令此分得圓滿故，精勤修習便能證得，由是因緣，此分圓滿。此分滿故，於一切分皆得圓滿。善男子！當知如是十一種分普攝諸地。」

“What does it mean to say that eleven parts encompass the stages?

1. Bodhisattvas on the initial stage of supreme, liberating practice, due to their extremely excellent cultivation of supremely liberated patience (*kṣānti*) reliant upon the practice of Ten Dharmas*, transcend that stage and enter realization of the correct nature of bodhisattvas being beyond birth. From these causes and conditions, bodhisattvas fulfill this part.

* copying, honoring, propagating, attending to, reading, maintaining, explaining, reciting, pondering, and cultivating

2. Yet, those bodhisattvas are still unable to correctly know and then act in regard to the appearance of subtle errors and mistakes, and from these causes and conditions, during this part they remain unfilled. In order to attain fulfillment of this part, they cultivate with the determination and are able to attain realization. From these causes and conditions, bodhisattvas fulfill this part.

3. Yet, those bodhisattvas have still not attained world fulfilling (transcending) equanimous  retention and [the perfect] hearing retention *dhāraṇī*, and from these causes and conditions, during this part they remain unfilled. In order to attain fulfillment of this part, they cultivate with the determination and are able to attain realization. From these causes and conditions, bodhisattvas fulfill this part.

4. Yet, they are still unable to be in accord with the Factors of Awakening they may attain, and though they cultivate a lot of abiding, the mind is still unable to relinquish affection for the equanimous and affection for *dharma*, and from these causes and conditions, during this part they remain unfilled. In order to attain fulfillment of this part, they cultivate with the determination and are able to attain realization. From these causes and conditions, bodhisattvas fulfill this part.

5. Yet, they are still unable to examine the principles of the Path of Truth as they really are, still unable to relinquish attachment to one-sided attraction or aversion for birth and death and Nirvana, and still unable to cultivate skillful means that harmonize (embrace) the Factors of Awakening, and from these causes and conditions, during this part they remain unfilled. In order to attain fulfillment of this part, they cultivate with the determination and are able to attain realization. From these causes and conditions, bodhisattvas fulfill this part.

6. Yet, they are still unable to examine transformations within the flow of birth and death as they really are, and also, from frequently developing revulsion toward so many [re]births, they are still unable to abide for long in characteristicless states of mind, and from these causes and conditions, during this part they remain unfilled. In order to attain fulfillment of this part, they cultivate with the determination and are able to attain realization. From these causes and conditions, bodhisattvas fulfill this part.

7. Yet, they are still unable to cause characteristicless states of mind without pause or interruption by cultivating long periods of abiding, and from these causes and conditions, during this part they remain unfilled. In order to attain fulfillment of this part, they cultivate with the determination and are able to attain realization. From these causes and conditions, bodhisattvas fulfill this part.

8. Yet, they are still unable to let go of purpose [use, function] while abiding in the  characteristicless, and have still not attained sovereignty over characteristics, and from these causes and conditions, during this part they remain unfilled. In order to attain fulfillment of this part, they cultivate with the determination and are able to attain realization. From these causes and conditions, bodhisattvas fulfill this part.

9. Yet, they are still unable to attain Great Sovereignty over different terms, groups, and characteristics, different ways of saying things, and all the different categories and interpretations of *dharmas,* and from these causes and conditions, during this part they remain unfilled. In order to attain fulfillment of this part, they cultivate with the determination and are able to attain realization. From these causes and conditions, bodhisattvas fulfill this part.

10. Yet, they are still unable to attain fulfillment of the realization of the appearance of the Dharma Body, and from these causes and conditions, during this part they remain unfilled. In order to attain fulfillment of this part, they cultivate with the determination and are able to attain realization. From these causes and conditions, bodhisattvas fulfill this part.

11. Yet, they are still unable to attain all-pervasive, subtle knowledge and subtle vision of all knowable realms of existence without attachment and without obstruction, and from these causes and conditions, during this part they remain unfilled. In order to attain fulfillment of this part, they cultivate with the determination and are able to attain realization. From these causes and conditions, bodhisattvas fulfill this part.

Since this part attains fulfillment, all parts attain fulfillment. Kulaputra! You should know, like this, eleven parts encompass the stages.”

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！何緣最初名極喜地？乃至何緣說名佛地？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! Why is it initially called the stage of Extreme Joy? And why is it then also called the stage of Buddha?”

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！成就大義，得未曾得出世間心，生大歡喜，是故最初名極喜地。遠離一切微細犯戒，是故第二名離垢地。由彼所得三摩地及聞持陀羅尼，能為無量智光依止，是故第三名發光地。由彼所得菩提分法，燒諸煩惱，智如火焰，是故第四名焰慧地。由即於彼菩提分法，方便修習最極艱難，方得自在，是故第五名極難勝地。現前觀察諸行流轉，又於無相多修作意方現在前，是故第六名現前地。能遠證入無缺無間無相作意，與清淨地共相隣接，是故第七名遠行地。由於無相得無功用，於諸相中不為現行煩惱所動，是故第八名不動地。於一切種說法自在，獲得無罪廣大智慧，是故第九名善慧地。麁重之身，廣如虛空，法身圓滿，譬如大雲，皆能遍覆，是故第十名法雲地。永斷最極微細煩惱及所知障，無著無礙，於一切種所知境界，現正等覺，故第十一說名佛地。」

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! Accomplishing great meaning and attaining a transcendent mind not hitherto attained in the world, there arises great delight and joy, and for this reason it is initially called the stage of **Extreme Joy**. Being far removed from all the minutest infractions of discipline, the second is called the stage of **Purity**. Having attained the stages of *samādhi* up to [the perfect] hearing retention *dhāraṇī*, which are the basis of support for the immeasurable Light of Wisdom, the third is called the stage of **Refulgence**. Having attained the *Dharmas* of the Factors of Awakening, all afflictions are burned away, knowledge being like flames of a fire, for this reason the fourth is called the stage of **Blazing Intellect**. Having skillfully cultivated what is extremely difficult about the *Dharmas* of the Factors of Awakening through mastery of skillfulness, the fifth is called the stage **Extremely Difficult to Conquer**. Observing the flow of transformations of *saṃskāra* manifest before them, and also from continual cultivation of mind-states on characteristiclessness, it manifests before them, the sixth is called the stage of **Manifestation**. Being able to enter far-reaching realization of a mind-state without pause or interruption and without characteristics, having parity with the characteristic of the stage of purity, the seventh is called the stage of **Gone Afar**. Having attained purposelessness in regard to characteristiclessness, and being among all characteristics but not being moved by the appearance of afflictions, the eighth is called the stage of **Immovability**. Obtaining infallible, expansive intellect, and mastery of all kinds of explanations of the Dharma, the ninth is called the stage of **Good Intellect**. The body of ‘coarse heaviness’ being as broad as vacuous space, the Dharma Body being fulfilled, just like a great cloud, able to completely cover everything, the tenth is called the stage of **Dharma Cloud**. Forever having severed the most minute, subtle afflictions and barriers to knowledge, without attachment, without obstruction, having correctly awakened to every kind of knowable realm, the eleventh is said to be the stage of Buddha.

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「於此諸地有幾愚癡、有幾麁重為所對治？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “How much ignorance (*avidyā*) is there in these stages, and how much ‘coarse heaviness’ is to be counteracted?”

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！此諸地中有二十二種愚癡、十一種麁重為所對治。謂於初地有二愚癡：一者、執著補特伽羅及法愚癡，二者、惡趣雜染愚癡；及彼麁重為所對治。於第二地有二愚癡：一者、微細誤犯愚癡，二者、種種業趣愚癡；及彼麁重為所對治。於第三地有二愚癡：一者、欲貪愚癡，二者、圓滿聞持陀羅尼愚癡；及彼麁重為所對治。於第四地有二愚癡：一者、等至愛愚癡，二者、法愛愚癡；及彼麁重為所對治。於第五地有二愚癡：一者、一向作意棄背生死愚癡，二者、一向作意趣向涅槃愚癡；及彼麁重為所對治。於第六地有二愚癡：一者、現前觀察諸行流轉愚癡，二者、相多現行愚癡；及彼麁重為所對治。於第七地有二愚癡：一者、微細相現行愚癡，二者一向無相作意方便愚癡；及彼麁重為所對治。於第八地有二愚癡：一者、於無相作功用愚癡，二者、於相自在愚癡；及彼麁重為所對治。於第九地有二愚癡：一者、於無量說法、無量法句文字、後後慧辯陀羅尼自在愚癡，二者辯才自在愚癡；及彼麁重為所對治。於第十地有二愚癡：一者、大神通愚癡，二者、悟入微細祕密愚癡；及彼麁重為所對治。於如來地有二愚癡：一者、於一切所知境界極微細著愚癡，二者、極微細礙愚癡；及彼麁重為所對治。

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! Within these stages there are twenty-two kinds of ignorance, and eleven kinds of ‘coarse heaviness’ to be counteracted.”

“In the Initial Stage there are two [kinds of] ignorance: 1. The ignorance of clinging to the *pudgala* and *dharmas*, and, 2. Ignorance of what leads to an evil rebirth; The ‘coarse heaviness’ of those is what is counteracted.”

“In the Second Stage there are two [kinds of] ignorance: 1. The ignorance of subtle transgressions and, 2. Ignorance of where all the various karmic actions lead; The The ‘coarse heaviness’ of those is what is counteracted.”

“In the Third Stage there are two [kinds of] ignorance: 1. The ignorance of desirousness, and 2. Ignorance of perfection of the hearing retention *dhāraṇī*; The ‘coarse heaviness’ of those is what is counteracted.”

“In the Fourth Stage there are two [kinds of] ignorance: 1. The ignorance of being in love with arriving at equanimity and, 2. Ignorantly loving Dharma (*dharma*?); The ‘coarse heaviness’ of those is what is counteracted.”

“In the Fifth Stage there are two [kinds of] ignorance: 1. The ignorance of being singularly focused on rejecting birth & death and, 2. The ignorance of being singularly focused on being directed toward Nirvana; The ‘coarse heaviness’ of those is what is counteracted.”

“In the Sixth Stage there are two [kinds of] ignorance: 1. The ignorance of bringing to presence and observing continuity within the flow of conditioned actions (*saṃskāra*), and, 2. The ignorance of frequently bringing to presence images; The ‘coarse heaviness’ of those is what is counteracted.”

“In the Seventh Stage there are two [kinds of] ignorance: 1. The ignorance of bringing to presence subtle characteristics of conditioned actions, and, 2. the ignorance of being singularly focused on bring to mind characteristiclessness as an *upayā*; The ‘coarse heaviness’ of those is what is counteracted.”

“In the Eighth Stage there are two [kinds of] ignorance: 1. The ignorance of making effort toward characteristiclessness, and 2. Ignorance of being sovereign over characteristics; The ‘coarse heaviness’ of those is what is counteracted.”

“In the Ninth Stage there are two [kinds of] ignorance: 1. Ignorance of the sovereign mastery of wise elocution of immeasurable explanations of the Dharma, immeasurable words, phrases and collections of Dharma and their *dhāraṇī*s, and, 2. Ignorance of the sovereign mastery of interpretation; The ‘coarse heaviness’ of those is what is counteracted.”  **

“In the Tenth Stage there are two [kinds of] ignorance: 1. Ignorance of Great Spiritual Power, and 2. Ignorance of awakened entry into the subtle mysteries; The ‘coarse heaviness’ of those is what is counteracted.”

“In the Stage of a Thus Come One there are two [kinds of] ignorance: 1. The ignorance of an extremely subtle attachment to all knowable realms, and, 2. The ignorance of extremely subtle obstacles; The ‘coarse heaviness’ of those is what is counteracted.”

「善男子！由此二十二種愚癡及十一種麁重故，安立諸地；而阿耨多羅三藐三菩提離彼繫縛。」

“Kulaputra! Since there are these twenty-two kinds of ignorance and eleven types of ‘coarse heaviness,’ the Stages have been well-established; And *anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi* transcends the bondage of [all] that.”  **

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！阿耨多羅三藐三菩提甚奇希有，乃至成就大利大果，令諸菩薩能破如是大愚癡羅網，能越如是大麁重稠林，現前證得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! *Anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi* is most rare indeed, for it is the achievement of the great benefit, the great result, whereby all bodhisattvas are enabled to break asunder the net of great ignorance, are enabled to pass through the forest of great ‘coarse heaviness’ and realize *anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi* in the present.”

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！如是諸地，幾種殊勝之所安立？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! The Stages being thus, how many kinds of excellence are they established by.”

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！略有八種：一者、增上意樂清淨；二者、心清淨；三者、悲清淨；四者、到彼岸清淨；五者、見佛供養承事清淨；六者、成熟有情清淨；七者、生清淨；八者、威德清淨。

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! In brief, there are eight kinds: 1. Purity of superior thoughtfulness; 2. Purity of mind; 3. Purity of compassion; 4. Purity of reaching the other shore; 5. Purity of seeing Buddhas and making offerings to them; 6. Purity of maturing sentient beings; 7. Purity of birth; and 8. Purity of awe-inspiring respect (*tejas*).

「善男子！於初地中，所有增上意樂清淨，乃至威德清淨；後後諸地乃至佛地，所有增上意樂清淨，乃至威德清淨，當知彼諸清淨展轉增勝，唯於佛地除生清淨。又初地中所有功德，於上諸地平等皆有，當知自地功德殊勝。一切菩薩十地功德皆是有上，佛地功德當知無上。」

“Kulaputra! In the Initial Stage, from the Purity of superior thoughtfulness up to the Purity of awe-inspiring respect, and all the other [stages] up to the Stage of Buddha, and their Purity of superior thoughtfulness up to the Purity of awe-inspiring respect, you should know, all of those Purities are excellent, only the Stage of Buddha is without the Purity of Birth. Further, the merit of the Initial Stage is equal to the merit of all the higher stages, but you should know that the merit of each stage is excellent. All ten of the Bodhisattva Stages have something that surpasses them, but the Stage of Buddha is unsurpassable.”

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！何因緣故說菩薩生，於諸有生最為殊勝？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! Why do you say that the birth of a bodhisattva is far superior to the births of all other sentient beings?”

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！四因緣故：一者、極淨善根所集起故；二者、故意思擇力所取故；三者、悲愍濟度諸眾生故；四者、自能無染除他染故。」

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! The are four reasons: 1.  Because [that birth] comes about from the most pure good roots; 2. Because it is taken on intentionally, through the power of discernment; 3. Because it compassionately liberates all sentient beings; and 4. Because, [being born] undefiled oneself, one is able to remove the defilements of others."

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！何因緣故說諸菩薩行廣大願、妙願、勝願？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! Why do you say that all bodhisattvas perform a great vow, a wondrous vow, a superior vow?”

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！四因緣故：謂諸菩薩，能善了知涅槃樂住，堪能速證；而復棄捨速證樂住；無緣無待發大願心；為欲利益諸有情故，處多種種長時大苦。是故我說彼諸菩薩行廣大願、妙願、勝願。」

The Buddha told Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva, “Kulaputra! There are four reasons: All bodhisattvas are well able to realize the joy of abiding in Nirvana and could quickly realize it; However, they renounce the rapid realization of that joyful abode; Without cause or necessity, they produce the mind of that great vow; Due to a desire to benefit all sentient beings they remain among great suffering of various kinds for a prolonged time. For these reasons, I have said that they perform a great vow, a wondrous vow, a superior vow.”

### Questions about the Pāramitās

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！是諸菩薩凡有幾種所應學事？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! Generally speaking, how many types of things should these bodhisattvas study?”

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！菩薩學事略有六種：所謂布施、持戒、忍辱、精進、靜慮、慧到彼岸。」

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! In general, there are six kinds of things the bodhisattva studies, which are: *dāna*, *śīla, kṣānti*, *vīrya*, *dhyāna*, and *prajñā pāramitās*.”

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！如是六種所應學事，幾是增上戒學所攝？幾是增上心學所攝？幾是增上慧學所攝？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! Of the six things like this that should be studied, how many are included in the study of superior discipline, how many are included in the study of superior mind [states], and how many are included in  superior wisdom?”

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！當知初三，但是增上戒學所攝；靜慮一種，但是增上心學所攝；慧是增上慧學所攝；我說精進遍於一切。」

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! You should know the first three are included in the study of superior discipline; *dhyāna* is the one type included in the study of superior mind [states]; and *prajñā* is included in the study of superior wisdom. I have explained that *vīrya* permeates them all.”

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！如是六種所應學事，幾是福德資糧所攝？幾是智慧資糧所攝？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! Of the six things like this that should be studied, how many are included in the ‘supplies’ (*saṃbhāra*) of merit, and how many are included in the ‘supplies’ of wisdom?”

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！若增上戒學所攝者，是名福德資糧所攝；若增上慧學所攝者，是名智慧資糧所攝；我說精進、靜慮二種遍於一切。」

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! Whatever is included in the study of superior discipline (i.e. *dāna*, *śīla,* and *kṣānti*) is known as something included in the supplies of merit; whatever is included in the study of superior wisdom (i.e. *prajñā*) is known as something included in the supplies of wisdom. I have explained that *vīrya* and *dhyāna* are two things that permeate both [merit and wisdom].”

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！於此六種所學事中，菩薩云何應當修學？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! Among these six things to study, how should bodhisattvas cultivate their study.”

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！由五種相應當修學：一者、最初於菩薩藏波羅蜜多相應微妙正法教中，猛利信解；二者、次於十種法行，以聞、思、修所成妙智，精進修行；三者、隨護菩提之心；四者、親近真善知識；五者、無間勤修善品。」

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! There are five kinds of characteristics they should cultivate the study of: 1. From the outset they should have intense faith in the characteristics of the wondrous correct Dharma teachings about the *pāramitās* found in the bodhisattva treasury; 2. They must zealously cultivate the wondrous wisdom accomplished through hearing, reflecting, and meditating on the ten practices concerning Dharma; 3. They preserve and protect the mind of awakening; 4. The draw near to a spiritual friends (*kalyāṇamitra*); and 5. They cultivate good qualities without interruption.”

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！何因緣故，施設如是所應學事，但有六數？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! Why are there just six things in number established as the things that should be studied.”

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！二因緣故：一者、饒益諸有情故；二者、對治諸煩惱故。當知前三饒益有情，後三對治一切煩惱。前三饒益諸有情者，謂諸菩薩由布施故，攝受資具饒益有情；由持戒故，不行損害逼迫惱亂，饒益有情；由忍辱故，於彼損害逼迫惱亂堪能忍受，饒益有情。後三對治諸煩惱者，謂諸菩薩由精進故，雖未永伏一切煩惱，亦未永害一切隨眠，而能勇猛修諸善品，彼諸煩惱不能傾動善品加行；由靜慮故，永伏煩惱；由般若故，永害隨眠。」

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! There are two reasons: 1. To benefit sentient beings; and 2. To counteract all the passions. You should, know, the first three [*pāramitās*] benefit sentient beings, while the latter three counteract all the passions. The first three benefit sentient beings because by *dāna* all bodhisattvas provide requisites to benefit sentient
beings. By *śīla* they benefit sentient beings in sparing them from injury, oppression, and irritation. By *kṣānti* they are able to benefit sentient beings, enabling them to patiently sustain injury, oppression, and irritation. The latter three counteract all the passions, for by *vīrya* bodhisattvas,
although they may not yet have suppressed all their passions forever or may not yet have eliminated all their passionate inclinations, are able diligently to cultivate good qualities, and all those passions become incapable of reversing their efforts toward goodness. By *dhyāna* they do suppress their passions forever, and by *prajñā* they eliminate their passionate inclinations forever.”

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！何因緣故，施設所餘波羅蜜多，但有四數？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! Why have you established the remaining *pāramitās* as just being four in number?”

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！由前六種波羅蜜多為助伴故。謂諸菩薩，於前三種波羅蜜多所攝有情，以諸攝事，方便善巧而攝受之，安置善品，是故我說方便善巧波羅蜜多與前三種而為助伴。若諸菩薩，於現法中煩惱多故，於修無間無有堪能，羸劣意樂故、下界勝解故，於內心住無有堪能，於菩薩藏不能聞緣善修習故，所有，不能引發出世間慧。彼便攝受少分狹劣福德資糧，為未來世煩惱輕微，心生正願，如是名願波羅蜜多。由此願故，煩惱微薄，能修精進，是故我說願波羅蜜多與精進波羅蜜多而為助伴。若諸菩薩，親近善士，聽聞正法，如理作意為因緣故，轉劣意樂成勝意樂，亦能獲得上界勝解，如是名力波羅蜜多。由此力故，於內心住有所堪能，是故我說力波羅蜜多與靜慮波羅蜜多而為助伴。若諸菩薩，於菩薩藏，已能聞緣善修習故，能發靜慮，如是名智波羅蜜多。由此智故，堪能引發出世間慧，是故我說智波羅蜜多與慧波羅蜜多而為助伴。」

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! Because they are aids to the former six *pāramitās*. Bodhisattvas use the the skillful *upāya* of the [Four] Means of Unification to embrace sentient beings, unifying them by the first three *pāramitās* and establishing them in good. Therefore I have explained that *upāya pāramitā* is an aid to the first three [*pāramitās*]. If there are bodhisattvas with many afflictions present, incapable of cultivation and continuity, and they have weak wills and inferior aspirations and so are incapable of inner mental stability, and are unable to hear the treasury of bodhisattvas and cultivate good, therefore their *dhyāna* cannot bring forth transmundane wisdom. Those [bodhisattvas] embrace a little bit of narrow inferior virtue and truly vow in their hearts that in the future their afflictions will diminish. This is called the *pāramitā* of Vowing. By this Vowing, afflictions are weakened and diligence can be cultivated, so I say that the *pāramitā* of vowing is an aid to the *pāramitā* of *vīrya*. If bodhisattvas draw near to good people, listen to the correct Dharma and think about it reasonably and thereby transform inferior will into superior will, and can also attain higher aspiration, this is called the *pāramitā* of Power. By this
Power, they have the capability of inner mental abiding, so I say the *pāramitā* of Power is an aid to the *pāramitā* of *dhyāna*. If bodhisattvas are able to hear the treasury of bodhisattva [teachings], focus on what is good, and cultivate its practice, they can develop *dhyāna*. This is called the *pāramitā* of Knowledge, by virtue of which Knowledge they are able to bring out transmundane wisdom. Therefore I say that the *pāramitā* of Knowledge is an aid to the *pāramitā* of *prajñā*."

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！何因緣故，宣說六種波羅蜜多如是次第？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! Why have you explained the six *pāramitās* in this order?”

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！能為後後引發依故。謂諸菩薩，若於身財無所顧悋，便能受持清淨禁戒；為護禁戒，便修忍辱；修忍辱已，能發精進；發精進已，能辦靜慮；具靜慮已，便能獲得出世間慧。是故我說波羅蜜多如是次第。」

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! Because each is a basis that enables the generating of the next. Which is to say, if bodhisattvas are not obsessed with the body or wealth [i.e. they are generous], then they can keep pure *śīla* discipline; By guarding that *śīla* discipline, they cultivate *kṣānti* patience; Having cultivated *kṣānti*, they then generate *vīrya* determination; Having generated *vīrya*, they are able to carry out *dhyāna* meditation; Being endowed with *dhyāna,* they become able to obtain transcendent *prajñā* wisdom. This is the reason I have explained the *pāramitās* in this order.”

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！如是六種波羅蜜多，各有幾種品類差別？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! What are the kinds of subdivisions of each of these six *pāramitās*?”

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！各有三種。施三種者：一者、法施；二者、財施；三者、無畏施。戒三種者：一者、轉捨不善戒；二者、轉生善戒；三者、轉生饒益有情戒。忍三種者：一者、耐怨害忍；二者、安受苦忍；三者、諦察法忍。精進三種者：一者、被甲精進；二者、轉生善法加行精進；三者、饒益有情加行精進。靜慮三種者：一者、無分別寂靜極寂靜無罪故，對治煩惱眾苦樂住靜慮；二者、引發功德靜慮；三者、引發饒益有情靜慮。慧三種者：一者、緣世俗諦慧；二者、緣勝義諦慧；三者、緣饒益有情慧。」

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! Each has three kinds [of subdivisions]. The three kinds of giving are: 1. Giving the Dharma, 2. Giving goods, and 3. Giving fearlessness. The three kinds of discipline are: 1. The discipline to turn away from what is not good, 2. The discipline to turn toward what is good, and 3. The discipline to turn toward benefiting sentient beings. The three kinds of patience are: 1. The patience to endure insult and injury, 2. The patience to abide peacefully upon receiving suffering, and 3. The patience to investigate *Dharma*. The three kinds of *vīrya* are: 1. *Vīrya* which protects one like armor, 2. *Vīrya* to exert effort in engendering good Dharmas, and 3. *Vīrya* to exert effort in benefiting sentient beings. The three kinds of *dhyāna* are: 1. The *dhyāna* of abiding in a joyful mind, which counteracts all the suffering of the passions because it is nondiscriminative, tranquil, very tranquil, and irreproachable, 2. *Dhyāna* that engenders virtue (merit); and 3. *Dhyāna* that produces benefit for sentient beings. The three kinds of wisdom are: 1. Wisdom that has as its object worldly, conventional truth, 2. Wisdom that has as its object the truth of ultimate meaning (*paramārtha*), and 3. Wisdom that has as its object the benefiting of sentient beings. ”

### Five Characteristics of the Pāramitās

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！何因緣故，波羅蜜多說名波羅蜜多？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! Why are the *pāramitās* called *pāramitās*?”

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！五因緣故：一者、無染著故；二者、無顧戀故；三者、無罪過故；四者、無分別故；五者、正迴向故。無染著者，謂不染著波羅蜜多諸相違事。無顧戀者，謂於一切波羅蜜多諸果異熟及報恩中心無繫縛。無罪過者，謂於如是波羅蜜多無間雜染法，離非方便行。無分別者，謂於如是波羅蜜多，不如言詞執著自相。正迴向者，謂以如是所作所集波羅蜜多，迴求無上大菩提果。」

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! There are five reasons: 1. Because they are **unattached**, 2. Because they are **disinterested**, 3. Because they are **irreproachable**, 4. Because they are **nondiscriminatory**, and 5. Because they correctly **transfer** [merit]. They are unattached because they are not attached to the opposites of the *pāramitās*. They are disinterested because the thought [that accompanies them] is not bound to the maturation or reward resulting from any of the *pāramitās*. They are beyond reproach because such *pāramitās* have nothing in common with defiled states and are apart from implementing evil means. They are without discrimination because the specific characteristics of these *pāramitās* do not cling to their literal meaning. They properly transfer [merit]  because such *pāramitās*, when practiced and accumulated, turn toward and seek the fruit of supreme awakening.”

「世尊！何等名為波羅蜜多諸相違事？」

“World-Honored One! What are the opposites of these *pāramitās*?”

「善男子！當知此事略有六種：一者、於喜樂欲財富自在諸欲樂中，深見功德及與勝利；二者、於隨所樂縱身、語、意而現行中，深見功德及與勝利；三者、於他輕蔑不堪忍中，深見功德及與勝利；四者、於不勤修著欲樂中，深見功德及與勝利；五者、於處憒鬧世雜亂行，深見功德及與勝利；六者、於見、聞、覺、知、言說戲論，深見功德及與勝利。」

“Kulaputra! You should know, there are six kinds of opposites: 1. Seeing profound merit and advantages in all pleasures such as joy, wealth, and power; 2. Seeing profound merit and advantages to indulging in the pleasures of body, speech, and mind; 3. Seeing profound merit and advantages in not being patient when humiliated by others; 4. Seeing profound merit and advantages in not motivating oneself to practice and being attached to pleasures; 5. Seeing profound merit and advantages to the hectic confusion and wild activities of the world; 6. Seeing profound merit and advantages in what is seen, heard, understood, known, talked about, and debated (*prapañca*).”

「世尊！如是一切波羅蜜多何果異熟？」

“World-Honored One! What are the varying (*vipāka*) fruits (results) of each of the *pāramitās?”*

「善男子！當知此亦略有六種：一者、得大財富；二者、往生善趣；三者、無怨無壞多諸喜樂；四者、為眾生主；五者、身無惱害；六者、有大宗葉。」

“Kulaputra! You should know, also generally speaking there are six kinds: 1. The attainment of great wealth; 2. Rebirth in good destinies; 3. Great pleasure and total joy without enemies or ruin; 4. Rulership among sentient beings; 5. A body without affliction or injury; 6. Being of great renown. (’having a great clan of petals’).”

「世尊！何等名為波羅蜜多間雜染法？」

“World-Honored One! What are things that adulterate (’stain’) the *pāramitās*?”

「善男子！當知略由四種加行：一者、無悲加行故；二者、不如理加行故；三者、不常加行故；四者、不慇重加行故。不如理加行者，謂修行餘波羅蜜多時，於餘波羅蜜多遠離失壞。」

“Kulaputra! You should know, in general it because of four kinds of intensified effort (*prayoga*): 1. Due to intensified effort without compassion; 2. Due to intensified effort that is not logical; 3. Due intensified effort that is not consistent; and 4. Due to intensified effort without consideration. Intensified effort that is not logical means cultivating one *pāramitā* while straying far from and losing the other *pāramitās.”*

「世尊！何等名為非方便行？」

“World-Honored One! What are practices that are not expedient?”

「善男子！若諸菩薩以波羅蜜多饒益眾生時，但攝財物饒益眾生便為喜足，而不令其出不善處安置善處，如是名為非方便行。何以故？善男子！非於眾生唯作此事名實饒益。譬如糞穢若多若少，終無有能令成香潔。如是眾生由行苦故，其性是苦，無有方便，但以財物暫相饒益，可令成樂，唯有安處妙善法中，方可得名第一饒益。」

“Kulaputra! When benefiting sentient beings by the *pāramitās,* if bodhisattvas only benefit sentient beings and bring them joy by means of material things, and yet they do not bring about them leaving bad places and becoming peacefully established in good places, this is what is called a practice that is not expedient. How so? Kulaputra! This is not doing something that truly benefits sentient beings. It’s just like manure, whether a lot or a little, you will never be able to turn it into perfume. And so, because sentient beings actions are suffering, their nature is suffering, and it is not expedient to only benefit them with fleeting images of material things. It can cause them to achieve happiness, but only the peaceful place within the subtle, Good Dharma can be called the foremost benefit.”

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！如是一切波羅蜜多有幾清淨？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! How much purity do these *pāramitās* have?

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！我終不說波羅蜜多，除上五相有餘清淨。然我即依如是諸事總別，當說波羅蜜多清淨之相。

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! I have never said that the *pāramitās* have any more purity than the five above characteristics. And so, with these as the basis, I will explain the general and specific characteristics of the purity of the *pāramitās.”*

「總說一切波羅蜜多清淨相者，當知七種。何等為七？一者、菩薩於此諸法不求他知；二者、於此諸法見已不生執著；三者、即於如是諸法不生疑惑，謂為能得大菩提不？四者、終不自讚毀他有所輕蔑；五者、終不憍傲放逸；六者、終不少有所得便生喜足；七者、終不由此諸法，於他發起嫉妬慳悋。

“Speaking general about the characteristics of the purity of all the *pāramitās*, you should know, there are seven kinds. What are the seven kinds? 1. Bodhisattvas do not seek the knowledge of others in regard to these Dharmas; 2. Having seen these Dharmas, they do not give rise to attachment; 3. Then they do not give rise to doubt in regard to Dharmas such as these, such as their ability to [bring about] attainment of great awakening, or not; 4. Never praising themselves, slandering others, without the slightest slight; 5. Never arrogant or unruly; 6. Never being satisfied too little or too much with their attainments; and 7. Never being jealous of or stingy with others because of these Dharmas.”              **

「別說一切波羅蜜多清淨相者，亦有七種。何等為七？謂諸菩薩，如我所說七種布施清淨之相，隨順修行。一者、由施物清淨行清淨施；二者、由戒清淨行清淨施；三者、由見清淨行清淨施；四者、由心清淨行清淨施；五者、由語清淨行清淨施；六者、由智清淨行清淨施；七者、由垢清淨行清淨施。是名七種施清淨相。

“Speaking specifically about the characteristics of the purity of all the *pāramitās*, there are also seven kinds. What are the seven kinds? As I have explained, there are seven kinds of characteristics of the purity of **giving** of all bodhisattvas, and cultivation of practices in accord with them. 1. Since their giving of things is pure, they practice pure giving; 2. Since their discipline is pure, they practice pure giving; 3. Since their vision is pure, they practice pure giving; 4. Since their minds are pure, they practice pure giving; 5. Since their speech is pure, they practice pure giving; Since their knowledge is pure, they practice pure giving; 7. Since their defilements are pure, they practice pure giving. These are called the characteristics of the seven kinds of purity of giving.”

「又諸菩薩，能善了知制立律儀一切學處，能善了知出離所犯，具常尸羅，堅固尸羅，常作尸羅，常轉尸羅，受學一切所有學處，是名七種戒清淨相。

“Furthermore, bodhisattvas able to understand well and observe the lessons of the established customs (’**Rules**), are able to understand and separate themselves from what is sinful, being replete with enduring *śīla*, steadfast *śīla*, constant *śīla*, perpetual *śīla*, and receive and learn every lesson to be learned. These are called the characteristics of the seven kinds of purity of discipline.”

「若諸菩薩於自所有業果異熟深生依信，一切所有不饒益事現在前時，不生憤發；亦不反罵、不瞋、不打、不恐、不弄、不以種種不饒益事反相加害；不懷怨結；若諫誨時不令恚惱；亦復不待他來諫誨；不由恐怖有染愛心而行忍辱；不以作恩而便放捨，是名七種忍清淨相。

“If bodhisattvas have deep faith toward their own dominant karmic fruitions (*adhipatiphala*) and are not upset by whatever unfavorable situation comes before them; Are not abusive, not angry, not violent, not fearful, not showy, not in any way malicious toward any kind of unfavorable situation;  do not harbor anger; Are not caused anguish when being corrected; Also do not wait for others to come correct them; Do not practice **patience** (*kṣānti*) due to a fearful or emotionally afflicted mind; and they are not kind out of pity. These are called the characteristics of the seven kinds of purity of patience.”

「若諸菩薩，通達精進平等之性；不由勇猛勤精進故自舉陵他；具大勢力；具大精進；有所堪能；堅固勇猛；於諸善法終不捨軛，如是名為七種精進清淨之相。

“If bodhisattvas have penetrated the equal nature of **determination** (*vīrya*); Do not honor themselves or denigrate others due to their bold, courageous vigor; Are replete with great power; Are replete with great determination; Have the foremost ability; Are steadfastly courageous; Never cast off the yoke of the Good Dharma. These are called the characteristics of the seven kinds of purity of determination.”

「若諸菩薩，有善通達相三摩地靜慮；有圓滿三摩地靜慮；有俱分三摩地靜慮；有運轉三摩地靜慮；有無所依三摩地靜慮；有善修治三摩地靜慮；有於菩薩藏聞緣修習無量三摩地靜慮，如是名為七種靜慮清淨之相。

‘If bodhisattvas have *samādhi **dhyāna*** that well penetrates characteristics; Have perfect *samādhi dhyāna*; Have complete *samādhi dhyāna;* Have progressive *samādhi dhyāna*; Have *samādhi dhyāna* that does not reply upon anything; Have well-cultivated and controlled *samādhi dhyāna*; and the immeasurable *samādhi dhyāna* of practicing the lessons learned from the Bodhisattva Treasury. These are called the characteristics of the seven kinds of purity of *dhyāna*.”

「若諸菩薩，遠離增益、損減二邊行於中道，是名為慧；由此慧故，如實了知解脫門義，謂空、無願、無相三解脫門；如實了知有自性義，謂遍計所執、若依他起、若圓成實三種自性；如實了知無自性義，謂相、生、勝義三種無自性性；如實了知世俗諦義，謂於五明處；如實了知勝義諦義，謂於七真如；又無分別離諸戲論純一理趣多所住故，無量總法為所緣故，及毘鉢舍那故；能善成辦法隨法行，是名七種慧清淨相。」

“If bodhisattvas are far removed from the two extremes of improvement or diminishment in their  practice of the Middle Way, this is what is known as **wisdom** (*prajñā*); Due to this wisdom, they truly understand the meaning of the doors of liberation, which are the three doors of liberation: emptiness, aimlessness, and characteristiclessness; They truly understand the meaning of having inherent nature, which are the three kinds of inherent nature: totally imagined, (*parikalpita*), arising in dependence upon another (*paratantra*), and the completely perfect (*pariniṣpanna*); They truly understand the meaning of being without inherent nature, which are the three kinds of natures that are without inherent nature: characteristics, arising, and ultimate meaning; They truly understand worldly, conventional meaning, where are the five places of illumination (’learning’ - literature, craftsmanship, medicine, logic, and doctrine); They truly understand the true meaning of ultimate meaning, which are the Seven Suchnesses; Furthermore, due to being free from all discursiveness (*prapañca*), without discrimination, abiding for long periods in the pure, unitary principle, due to objectifying the immeasurable, unified Dharma, and due to their *vipaśyanā,* they are well able to carry out the practice of the Dharma in accord with the Dharma. These are called the characteristics of the seven kinds of purity of wisdom.”

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！如是五相各有何業？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! What karma does each of the five characteristics have?”

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！當知彼相有五種業，謂諸菩薩無染著故，於現法中於所修習波羅蜜多，恒常殷重勤修加行無有放逸。無顧戀故，攝受當來不放逸因。無罪過故，能正修習極善圓滿、極善清淨極善鮮白波羅蜜多。無分別故，方便善巧波羅蜜多，速得圓滿。正迴向故，一切生處波羅蜜多及彼可愛諸果異熟，皆得無盡，乃至無上正等菩提。」

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! You should know those five characteristics have five kinds of karma, which are: because bodhisattvas are unattached, in their cultivation of the *pāramitās* amidst manifest dharmas they ever abundantly increase their practice without laxity. Because they are disinterested, they embrace the causes of not be lax in the future. Because they are irreproachable, they are able to correctly cultivate the most well perfected, most well purified, most well rarefied *pāramitā*. Because they are nondiscriminatory, their expedient skillfullness in the *pāramitās* quickly attains fulfillment. Because they correctly transfer [merit], wherever they may be, the *pāramitās* and their pleasant fruits will all be inexhaustible, up to their unsurpassable, correct awakening (*anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi*).”

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！如是所說波羅蜜多，何者最廣大？何者無染污？何者最明盛？何者不可動？何者最清淨？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! As you have explained the *pāramitās* thus, what is it that is most expansive? What is it that is without defilement? What is it that is most radiant? What is it that is immovable? What is it that is most purified?”

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！無染著性、無顧戀性、正迴向性，最為廣大。無罪過性、無分別性，無有染污。思擇所作，最為明盛。已入無退轉法地者，名不可動。若十地攝、佛地攝者，名最清淨。」

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! The nature of being without defiling attachment, the nature of disinterest, and the nature of correct transference [of merit] are what are most expansive. The nature of being irreproachable and the nature of being nondiscriminatory are what are without defilement. Thoughtful action is what is most radiant. One who has entered the stage of a non-regressing Dharma turning is called immovable. If the Ten Stages have been embraced, and one has embraced the stage of Buddha[hood], this is called most purified.”

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！何因緣故，菩薩所得波羅蜜多諸可愛果及諸異熟常無有盡？波羅蜜多亦無有盡？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! Why are the pleasant fruits and developments of the *pāramitās* that bodhisattvas attain eternal and inexhaustible? Are the *pāramitās* also inexhaustible?"

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！展轉相依生起修習無間斷故。」

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! Because of the uninterrupted cultivation of severance [from] the dependent arising of the characteristics of expansion and revolution.”

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！何因緣故，是諸菩薩深信愛樂波羅蜜多，非於如是波羅蜜多所得可愛諸果異熟？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! Why do bodhisattvas have profound faith and joyful fondness for the *pāramitās*, and not for the pleasant fruits and developments of these *pāramitās*?”

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！五因緣故：一者、波羅蜜多是最增上喜樂因故；二者、波羅蜜多是其究竟饒益一切自他因故；三者、波羅蜜多是當來世彼可愛果異熟因故；四者、波羅蜜多非諸雜染所依事故；五者、波羅蜜多非是畢竟變壞法故。」

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! There are five reasons: 1. The *pāramitās* are the cause of supreme joy and bliss. 2. The *pāramitās* are the cause of ultimate benefit for everyone, oneself and others included. 3. The *pāramitās* are the cause of pleasant rewards in the future. 4. The *pāramitās* are not a basis for defilement. 5. The *pāramitās* are not things that ultimately change and perish."

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！一切波羅蜜多，各有幾種最勝威德？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! How many kinds of august qualities does each of the *pāramitās* have?"

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！當知一切波羅蜜多，各有四種最勝威德：一者、於此波羅蜜多正修行時，能捨慳悋、犯戒、心憤、懈怠、散亂、見趣所治；二者、於此正修行時，能為無上正等菩提、真實資糧；三者、於此正修行時，於現法中能自攝受饒益有情；四者、於此正修行時，於未來世能得廣大無盡可愛諸果異熟。」

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! You should know, each of the *pāramitās* has four kinds of august qualities: 1. When cultivating these *pāramitās* correctly, one is able to relinquish stinginess, transgression, exasperation, idleness, distractedness, and views, their opposites; 2. When cultivating them correctly, one is able to [accumulate] the true supplies for
unexcelled, supreme awakening; 3. When cultivating them correctly, even in the present world, one is able to embrace within oneself benefit for sentient beings; 4. When cultivating them correctly, one is able to attain expansive, inexhaustible favorable results from their maturation in the future. ”

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！如是一切波羅蜜多，何因？何果？有何義利？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! What is the cause of each of the *pāramitās*? What are the results (’fruit’)? What benefit do they have?”  **

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！如是一切波羅蜜多，大悲為因；微妙可愛諸果異熟，饒益一切有情為果；圓滿無上廣大菩提為大義利。」

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! Each of these *pāramitās* has great compassion as its cause.; The maturing of their subtle, wonderous favorable results benefit all sentient beings is the result; and the fulfillment of supreme, expansive awakening is their great benefit.”

觀自在菩薩白佛言：「世尊！若諸菩薩具足一切無盡財寶成就大悲，何緣世間現有眾生貧窮可得？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! If bodhisattvas are endowed with inexhaustible riches and they achieve Great Compassion, why is there still poverty to be found among people in the world?"

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！是諸眾生自業過失！若不爾者，菩薩常懷饒益他心，又常具足無盡財寶，若諸眾生無自惡業能為障礙，何有世間貧窮可得？譬如餓鬼為大熱渴逼迫其身，見大海水悉皆涸竭；非大海過，是諸餓鬼自業過耳。如是菩薩所施財寶猶如大海無有過失，是諸眾生自業過耳，猶如餓鬼自惡業力令無有果。」

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! That is the error of all sentient being’s own karma! If it were not so, bodhisattvas could always cherish the mind to benefit others and always be endowed with inexhaustible riches, but if it were not for the obstacles created by sentient beings’ own evil karma, how could poverty be found in the world? Just like hungry ghosts, their bodies oppressed by great heat and thirst, watching the water of a great sea evaporate; it is not the sea’s fault. It is the fault of those hungry ghosts own karma! Like this, the riches given by the bodhisattva, like the great sea, have no fault, it is the fault of sentient being’s own karma! Just like the power of hungry ghosts’ own evil karma cause them to be without results.”

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！菩薩以何等波羅蜜多，取一切法無自性性？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! By which *pāramitā* do bodhisattvas apprehend the inherent nature-less nature of all dharmas?”

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！以般若波羅蜜多能取諸法無自性性。」

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! It is by *Prajñāpāramitā* that the inherent nature-less nature of all *dharmas* is apprehened.”

「世尊！若般若波羅蜜多能取諸法無自性性，何故不取有自性性？」

“World-Honored One! If *Prajñāpāramitā* is able to apprehend the inherent nature-less nature of all *dharmas*, why does it not apprehend the nature of having an inherent nature?”

「善男子！我終不說以無自性性取無自性性。然無自性性，離諸文字自內所證；不可捨於言說文字而能宣說。是故我說般若波羅蜜多能取諸法無自性性。」

“Kulaputra! I have never said that the inherent nature-less nature of all *dharmas* is apprehended by inherently nature-less nature. Although the nature of lacking inherent nature is beyond all words and letters, something internally self-realized, yet it cannot be explained it in speech by rejecting words and letters. For this reason, I have said *Prajñāpāramitā is* able to apprehend the inherent nature-less nature of all *dharmas*.”

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！如佛所說波羅蜜多，近波羅蜜多，大波羅蜜多。云何波羅蜜多？云何近波羅蜜多？云何大波羅蜜多？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! As the Buddha explains *pāramitā* (’crossing over’), nearing *pāramitā*, the great *pāramitā*. What is *pāramitā*? What is nearing *pāramitā*? What is great *pāramitā*?” **  **

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！若諸菩薩經無量時修行施等成就善法，而諸煩惱猶故現行，未能制伏然為彼伏，謂於勝解行地軟中勝解轉時，是名波羅蜜多。復於無量時修行施等，漸復增上，成就善法，而諸煩惱猶故現行，然能制伏非彼所伏，謂從初地已上，是名近波羅蜜多。復於無量時修行布施等，轉復增上，成就善法，一切煩惱皆不現行，謂從八地已上，是名大波羅蜜多。」

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! If bodhisattvas spend immeasurable amounts of time cultivating the practice of giving, etc., achieving good dharmas, yet habits of affliction still appear, and rather than being able to control them, they are controlled by them. This ‘turning of liberation’ when resting within the stage of liberating practice is called *pāramitā*. Through further immeasurable amounts of time they cultivate the practice of giving, etc., progressing further and increasing their achievement of good dharmas, yet habits of affliction still appear, but they *are* able to control them, and are not controlled by them. From the initial stage and above, this is called nearing *pāramitā*. Through further immeasurable amounts of time they cultivate the practice of giving, etc., progressing further and increasing their achievement of good *dharmas*, and all habits of affliction do not appear. From the eighth stage and above, this is called the great *pāramitā*.”

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！此諸地中煩惱隨眠可有幾種？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! Among  these stages, how many kinds of afflicted torpor are to be found ?”

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！略有三種：一者、害伴隨眠，謂於前五地。何以故？善男子！諸不俱生現行煩惱，是俱生煩惱現行助伴，彼於爾時永無復有，是故說名害伴隨眠；二者、羸劣隨眠，謂於第六、第七地中微細現行，若修所伏不現行故；三者、微細隨眠，謂於第八地已上，從此已去，一切煩惱不復現行，唯有所知障為依止故。」

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! In general, there are three: 1. Torpor that harms companions, which is found in the first five stages. How so? Kulaputra! All the afflictions that do not arise together with activity (’the appearance of *saṃskāra’*) **are the companions of the afflictions that do arise together with activity, for this reason it is said that there is torpor that harms companions; 2. Emaciating torpor, which is subtly practiced during the sixth and seventh stages, because if one cultivates control, activity does not appear; 3. Subtle torpor, which is from the eighth stage and above, from here on out all afflictions are no longer active because they only rest upon the obstacle to the knowable.”

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！此諸隨眠，幾種麁重斷所顯示？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! By cutting off how many kinds of ‘coarse heavinesses’ are these torpors revealed?”

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！但由二種：謂由在皮麁重斷故，顯彼初二，復由在膚麁重斷故，顯彼第三。若在於骨麁重斷者，我說永離一切隨眠，位在佛地。」

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! There are just two kinds: Since  the ‘coarse heaviness’ of the skin (’the superficial’) is cut off, the first two [torpors] are revealed, and since the ‘coarse heaviness’ of the flesh is cut off, the third is revealed. If one cuts off the ‘coarse heaviness’ of the bones, I say that one has forever left all torpor and is established in the stage of Buddha[hood]."

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！經幾不可數劫能斷如是麁重？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! Throughout how many incalculable *kalpas* [does it take] to be able to cut off ‘coarse heaviness’ like this?”

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！經於三大不可數劫、或無量劫，所謂年、月、半月、晝夜、一時、半時、須臾、瞬息、剎那量劫不可數故。」

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! Throughout three great, incalculable kalpas, or immeasurable kalpas, because they consist of immeasurable *kalpas* of years, months, half-months, days and nights, moments, half moments, *kṣaṇas*, and thought moments.”

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！是諸菩薩於諸地中所生煩惱，當知何相？何失？何德？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! Afflictions that arise in these bodhisattvas in the stages, what are characteristics should be known? What faults? What merits?"

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！無染污相。何以故？是諸菩薩於初地中，定於一切諸法法界已善通達，由此因緣，菩薩要知方起煩惱非為不知，是故說名無染污相。於自身中不能生苦，故無過失。菩薩生起如是煩惱，於有情界能斷苦因，是故彼有無量功德。」

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! Undefiled characteristics. Why? Bodhisattvas in the first stage, having already assuredly well penetrated the Dharma Realm of all *dharmas*, from these causes and conditions, afflictions arise with the full knowing of those bodhisattvas and not from unknowing, for this reason they are called undefiled characteristics. They are not able to bring about suffering toward [being] within their own body, and are therefore faultless. Bodhisattvas, giving rise to afflictions such as these, are able to cut off the causes of suffering in the realm of sentient beings and therefore have immeasurable merit.”

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「甚奇！世尊！無上菩提乃有如是大功德利，令諸菩薩生起煩惱，尚勝一切有情、聲聞、獨覺善根，何況其餘無量功德？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “Most rare! World-Honored One! The great merit and benefit of supreme awakening, causing all bodhisattvas to give rise to affliction, yet surpassing the good roots of all sentient beings, voice-hearers, and the solitary awakened, to say nothing of their remaining immeasurable merit."

觀自在菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！如世尊說：『若聲聞乘、若復大乘，唯是一乘。』此何密意？」

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! As the World-Honored One has said, ‘Whether the Voice-Hearer Vehicle or the Great Vehicle, there is only one vehicle.’ What is the secret meaning to this?

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！如我於彼聲聞乘中，宣說種種諸法自性，所謂五蘊、或內六處、或外六處，如是等類；於大乘中，即說彼法同一法界、同一理趣，故我不說乘差別性。於中或有如言於義妄起分別，一類增益，一類損減。又於諸乘差別道理，謂互相違，如是展轉遞興諍論。如是名為此中密意。」

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! Within that vehicle for voice-hearers I have proclaimed the inherent nature of all the various dharmas, such as the five aggregates, the six internal bases, the six external bases, and these kinds of things. Within the Great Vehicle it is then explained that those *dharmas* are identical to the Dharmadhatu, are identical to the same principle, therefore I do not say that the vehicles have a differentiated nature. From this there may be those who have a mistaken notion, taking the meaning of these words literally, differentiating one kind as better, and one kind as worse, or further, differentiating the vehicles as being logical or contradictory, and thus turning in argumentation among themselves. That is the secret meaning to this.”

爾時，世尊欲重宣此義，而說頌曰：

At that time the World-Honored One, wanting to emphasize the meaning of this, spoke in verse saying:

諸地攝想所對治，　　
殊勝生願及諸學，　
由依佛說是大乘，　　
於此善修成大覺。

The stages, gathered perceptions, and what is counteracted,
The preeminent giving rise to vows, and all that is studied,
Being dependent upon the words of the Buddha, this is the Great Vehicle,
Cultivating this well, one achieves the great awakening. 　

宣說諸法種種性，　　
復說皆同一理趣，
謂於下乘或上乘，　　
故我說乘無異性。

It is said that *dharmas* have all kinds of natures,
And further said that they are all identical to the same principle,
Which then becomes an inferior vehicle and a superior vehicle,
Therefore I have said that the vehicle is without a differentiated nature.

如言於義妄分別，　　
或有增益或損減，　
謂此二種互相違，　　
愚癡意解成乖諍。」

To differentiate mistakenly, taking the meaning of these words literally,
There being a ‘better’ or a ‘worse’,
Which then becomes two kinds being opposed to each other,
[This is] ignorant understanding that leads to argument.

爾時，觀自在菩薩摩訶薩復白佛言：「世尊！於是解深密法門中，此名何教？我當云何奉持？」

At that time, Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva mahasattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! Within this Dharma Door that reveals the profound secret, what is this teaching called? How should I respectfully remember it?

佛告觀自在菩薩曰：「善男子！此名諸地波羅蜜多了義之教，於此諸地波羅蜜多了義之教，汝當奉持！」

The Buddha replied to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! It is called the explicit teaching on the stages [and] *pāramitās*, and by explicit teaching on the stages [and] *pāramitās* you should respectfully remember it!”

說此諸地波羅蜜多了義教時，於大會中有七十五千菩薩，皆得菩薩大乘光明三摩地。

When this explicit teaching on the stages [and] *pāramitās* [was taught], seventy-five thousand bodhisattvas among the great assembly completely attained the bodhisattva’s Light of the Mahayana samadhi.
## Chapter 8 - The Accomplishments of the ‘doings’ of the Tathagata

如來成所作事品第八

爾時，曼殊室利菩薩摩訶薩請問佛言：「世尊！如佛所說如來法身，如來法身有何等相？」

At that time, Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva mahasattva inquired of the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! As the Buddha has explained the Dharma Body of the Thus Come One, what are the characteristics of the the Dharma Body of the Thus Come One?”

佛告曼殊室利菩薩曰：「善男子！若於諸地波羅蜜多，善修出離，轉依成滿，是名如來法身之相。當知此相，二因緣故不可思議：無戲論故，無所為故。而諸眾生計著戲論，有所為故。」

The Buddha replied to Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! Being well cultivated in the transcendence of the stages and *pāramitās,* [and] completely converting (’transforming’) the reliance (’base’), these are called the characteristics of the the Dharma Body of the Thus Come One. You should know, these characteristics are inconceivable for two reasons: Because they are without elaboration (*prapañca*), and because they are unconditioned.  Yet, sentient beings all imagine and cling to elaborations about the conditioned.”

「世尊！聲聞、獨覺所得轉依，名法身不？」

World-Honored One! Is the conversion of the base of voice-hearers and solitary awakened ones called the Dharma Body, or not?”

「善男子！不名法身。」

“Kulaputra! It is not called the Dharma Body.”

「世尊！當名何身？」

“World-Honored One! What should that body be called?”

「善男子！名解脫身。由解脫身故，說一切聲聞、獨覺與諸如來平等平等；由法身故，說有差別。如來法身有差別故，無量功德最勝差別，算數譬喻所不能及。」

“Kulaputra! It is called the Liberation Body. It is in regard to the Liberation Body that it is said that voice-hearers, solitary awakened ones, and all Thus Come Ones are equal. It is in regard to the Dharma Body that it is said that there is a difference [between them]. Because there is a difference between the Dharma Body of the Thus Come One, a difference of immeasurable superior merit unable to be calculated or compared.”

曼殊室利菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！我當云何應知如來生起之相？」

Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! How should I understand the characteristics of the arising of the Thus Come One?”

佛告曼殊室利菩薩曰：「善男子！一切如來化身作業，如世界起一切種類；如來功德眾所莊嚴，住持為相。當知化身相有生起，法身之相無有生起。」

The Buddha replied to Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! The karma performed by the transformational bodies of every Thus Come One are like the arisings of all the kinds and types of things in the world; characterized by the sustainment of the adornments of the accumulated merit of the Thus Come One. You should know, the characteristics of transformational bodies have arising. Characteristics of the Dharma Body are without arising.”

曼殊室利菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！云何應知示現化身方便善巧？」

Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! How should one understand the appearance of the skillful *upāya* of transformational bodies?”

佛告曼殊室利菩薩曰：「善男子！遍於一切三千大千佛國土中，或眾推許增上王家，或眾推許大福田家，同時入胎、誕生、長大、受欲、出家、示行苦行、捨苦行已成等正覺，次第示現。是名如來示現化身方便善巧。」

The Buddha replied to Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! Throughout all the three thousand great thousand Buddha Lands, in honorable and royal households, or in honorable and wealthy households, at that time there is entering the womb, birth, growing up, experiencing desire, leaving home, performing austerities and, relinquishing the practice of austerities, achieving supreme correct awakening, manifesting each one at a time. This is called the appearance of the skillful *upāya* of transformational bodies of the Thus Come One.”

曼殊室利菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！凡有幾種，一切如來身所住持言音差別？由此言音所化有情，未成熟者令其成熟，已成熟者緣此為境速得解脫？」

Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! How many kinds of voices are sustained by each body of the Thus Come Ones? By which these voices transform sentient beings, causing those not yet matured to become mature, and those already matured to quickly attain liberation?

佛告曼殊室利菩薩曰：「善男子！如來言音略有三種：一者、契經；二者、調伏；三者、本母。」

The Buddha replied to Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! In general, there are three kinds of voices of the Thus Come One: 1. Sutras, 2. Discipline, and 3. The ‘originating mothers’ (i.e. *mātṛkā*).”

「世尊！云何契經？云何調伏？云何本母？」

“World-Honored One! What are the sutras? What is the Discipline? What are the originating mothers?”

### Sutra

「曼殊室利！若於是處，我依攝事顯示諸法，是名契經。謂依四事，或依九事，或復依於二十九事。

“Mañjuśrī! If, in regard to these foundations, I rely upon means of unification (*saṃgraha-vastu*) to demonstrate the Dharma, this is called a sutra. This may depend upon four means (’doings’), or upon nine means, or again it may depend upon twenty-nine things. “

「云何四事？一者、聽聞事；二者、歸趣事；三者、修學事；四者、菩提事。

What are the four means? 1. Learning; 2. Refuge (’surrender’); 3. Study; and 4. Bodhi.”

「云何九事？一者、施設有情事；二者、彼所受用事；三者、彼生起事；四者、彼生已住事；五者、彼染淨事；六者、彼差別事；七者、能宣說事；八者、所宣說事；九者、諸眾會事。

What are the nine means? 1. Establishing sentient beings; 2. Their experiences; 3. Their birth; 4. Their abiding after birth; 5. Their purification; 6. Their differences; 7. Their ability to be taught; 8. What is taught; and 9. The assemblies.”

「云何名為二十九事？謂依雜染品有：攝諸行事，彼次第隨轉事，即於是中作補特伽羅想已，於當來世流轉因事，作是想已，於當來世流轉因事。依清淨品有：繫念於所緣事，即於是中勤精進事，心安住事，現法樂住事，超一切苦緣方便事，彼遍知事。此復三種：顛倒遍知所依處故，依有情想外有情中邪行遍知所依處故，內離增上慢遍知所依處故。修依處事，作證事，修習事，令彼堅固事，彼行相事，彼所緣事，已斷未斷觀察善巧事，彼散亂事，彼不散亂事，不散亂依處事，不棄修習劬勞加行事，修習勝利事，彼堅牢事，攝聖行事，攝聖行眷屬事，通達真實事，證得涅槃事，於善說法毘奈耶中世間正見超昇一切外道所得正見頂事，及即於此不修退事，於善說法毘奈耶中不修習故，說名為退，非見過失，故名為退。

What are the twenty-nine means? These are [first], things which depend upon defilement: The gathering [together] of all habits/conditioning (*saṁskāra*), their subsequent turning, which then, within this, since there is the perception of a *pudgala* (’self’), there is the continued turning in the future, and, having had this perception, there is the continued turning in the future. [Then] there are things which depend upon purification: Binding mindfulness to the object [of meditation], diligent *virya* therein, the mind peacefully abiding, abiding in the presence of Dharma joy, the *upaya* of transcending all states of suffering, and pervasive knowledge of these. This has three further kinds: The pervasive knowledge of the basis of inversion, the pervasive knowledge of the basis of heretical practices among outsiders that depend upon the perception of sentient beings, and the pervasive knowledge of the basis of the absence of pride among insiders (i.e. the orthodox). [Then there is] cultivation [of meditation] based on the foundations, realization, and practice, which causes one to be steadfast, the activities [of meditation], the objects [of meditation], skillfulness in knowing what has already been abandoned and what has yet to be abandoned, distractions [to meditation], the basis for not being distracted, persevering (increased effort, *prayoga*) in cultivation, the benefits [of meditation], its steadfastness, the embracing of sagely practice, embracing the aids to sagely practice, penetrating reality, the realization of Nirvana, the correct view held by those of the world regarding the well-explained Dharma surpasses the correct view of outsiders, and the regression that comes from not cultivating, and because of not practicing insight into the well-explained Dharma it is called regressing. It is not called regressing because of mistaken views.”

### Vinaya

「曼殊室利！若於是處，我依聲聞及諸菩薩，顯示別解脫及別解脫相應之法，是名調伏。」

Mañjuśrī! If, in regard to these foundations, I rely upon the Dharma(s) of liberation (別解脫 - *prātimokṣa*) and the characteristics of those Dharmas that I have revealed to voice-hearers and bodhisattvas, this is called Discipline.

「世尊！菩薩別解脫，幾相所攝？」

“World-Honored One! How many aspects are there to the bodhisattva-*prātimokṣa*?”

「善男子！當知七相：一者、宣說受軌則事故；二者、宣說隨順他勝事故；三者、宣說隨順毀犯事故；四者、宣說有犯自性故；五者、宣說無犯自性故；六者、宣說出所犯故；七者、宣說捨律儀故。

“Kulaputra! You should know there are seven aspects: 1. Instruction on things pertaining to receiving the (or, the received) rules; 2. Instruction on things pertaining to being in accord with them; 3. Instruction on things pertaining to being in accord with transgression; 4. Instruction on things pertaining to the nature of transgression; 5. Instruction on things pertaining to the nature of not transgressing; 6. Instruction on things pertaining to how to depart from transgression; and 7. Instruction on the relinquishment of proper conduct.”

### Mātṛkā - Eleven Characteristics

「曼殊室利！若於是處，我以十一種相決了分別顯示諸法，是名本母。何等名為十一種相？一者、世俗相；二者、勝義相；三者、菩提分法所緣相；四者、行相；五者、自性相；六者、彼果相；七者、彼領受開示相；八者、彼障礙法相；九者、彼隨順法相；十者、彼過患相；十一者、彼勝利相。

Mañjuśrī! If, in regard to these foundations, I define, analyze, and demonstrate things in terms of eleven kinds of characteristics, these are called the originating mothers (*mātṛkā*). What are these eleven kinds of characteristics? 1. Characteristics of worldly conventions; 2. Characteristics of ultimate meaning; 3. Characteristics of the objects that are aids to awakening; 4. Characteristics of practice [of the aids to awakening]; 5. Characteristics of inherent nature [of the aids to awakening]; 6. Characteristics of [karmic] results [of the aids to awakening]; 7. Characteristics of the explanations [of the aids to awakening]; 8. Characteristics of things that obstruct [the aids to awakening]; 9. Characteristics of things in accord [with the aids to awakening]; 10. Characteristics of things harmful [to the aids to awakening]; and 11. Characteristics that benefit [the aids to awakening].”

Characteristics 1 - 3

「世俗相者，當知三種：一者、宣說補特伽羅故；二者、宣說遍計所執自性故；三者、宣說諸法作用事業故。勝義相者，當知宣說七種真如故。菩提分法所緣相者，當知宣說遍一切種所知事故。

“Characteristics of worldly conventions, you should know, are of three kinds: 1. Instruction about *pudgalas*; 2. Instruction about clinging to totally imaginary inherent natures; 3. Instruction about the karma of the using and doing of all dharmas. The Characteristic of the Ultimate Meaning, you should know, is explained (instructed) by the Seven Suchnesses. The characteristics of the objects of the aids to awakening, you should know, pervade knowledge of the doing of all kinds of things.”

Characteristic 4 - Eight practices of insight

「行相者，當知宣說八行觀故。云何名為八行觀耶？一者、諦實故；二者、安住故；三者、過失故；四者、功德故；五者、理趣故；六者、流轉故；七者、道理故；八者、總別故。

“Characteristics of practice, you should know, are explained by the eight practices of insight. What are called the eight practices of insight? 1. Truth; 2. Propositions; 3. Errors; 4. Merit; 5. Principles; 6. Turning (*saṃsāra*); 7. Reason; 8. Unity and difference.”

Characteristic 4.1

「諦實者，謂諸法真如。

“Truth refers to the suchness of all *dharmas*.”

Characteristic 4.2 - 4.3

「安住者，謂或安立補特伽羅，或復安立諸法遍計所執自性，或復安立一向、分別、反問、置記，或復安立隱密、顯了、記別、差別。過失者，謂我宣說諸雜染法，有無量門差別過患。

“Propositions refer to proposing a *pudgala*, or proposing the inherent nature of the totally imagined that is clung to, or propositions that are one-sided, contrary, or silent, or propositions that are secret, revealed, predicted, or differentiated. Errors refer to what I have explained as all defiling *dharmas* in immeasurable different teachings on error.”

Characteristic 4.5

「功德者，謂我宣說諸清淨法，有無量門差別勝利。

“Merit refers to what I have explained as pure *dharmas* in immeasurable different teachings on what is advantageous.”

Characteristic 4.6 - Six kinds of Principles

「理趣者，當知六種：一者、真義理趣；二者、證得理趣；三者、教導理趣；四者、遠離二邊理趣；五者、不可思議理趣；六者、意趣理趣。

Principles you should know, are of six kinds: 1. The principle of meaning of Truth; 2. The principle of realization; 3. The principle of guidance; 4. The principle of transcending the two extremes; 5. The principle of inconceivability; and 6. The principle of intention.”

Characteristic 4.6

「流轉者，所謂三世三有為相，及四種緣。

“*Saṃsāra* refers to the three times, the three characteristics of the conditioned [arising, abiding, and ceasing], and the four kinds of causes [direct, antecedent, objective, and dominant].”

Characteristic 4.7 - Four kinds of logical reasoning

「道理者，當知四種：一者、觀待道理；二者、作用道理；三者、證成道理；四者、法爾道理。觀待道理者，謂若因若緣，能生諸行，及起隨說，如是名為觀待道理。作用道理者，謂若因若緣，能得諸法，或能成辦，或復生已作諸業用，如是名為作用道理。證成道理者，謂若因若緣，能令所立、所說、所標、義得成立，令正覺悟，如是名為證成道理。

Logical reasoning, you should know, is of four kinds: 1. Logical reasoning from observation; 2. Logical reasoning from function; 3. Logical reasoning from realization; and 4. Logical reasoning according to natural law. Logical reasoning from observation refers to causes and conditions that are able to give rise to all conditioned behaviors (*saṃskāra*) and their subsequent [verbal] descriptions. This is called logical reasoning from observation. Logical reasoning from function refers to causes and conditions which are able to attain all Dharmas, or able to bring them to completion, or that, once arisen, put them into action. This is called logical reasoning from function. Logical reasoning from realization refers to causes and conditions that are able to cause establishment, explanation, indication, and understanding of the meaning, which [in turn] cause correct awakening. This is called logical reasoning from realization.”

「又此道理略有二種：一者、清淨；二者不清淨。由五種相名為清淨，由七種相名不清淨。

“Moreover, this logical reasoning [from realization] , generally speaking, is of two kinds: 1. Pure; and 2. Not pure. There are five aspects to what is called pure, and there are seven aspects of what is called not pure.”

Characteristic 4.7.3.1 - Five pure aspects of logical reasoning from realization

「云何由五種相名為清淨？一者、現見所得相；二者、依止現見所得相；三者、自類譬喻所引相；四者、圓成實相；五者、善清淨言教相。

“What are the five aspects [of logical reasoning from realization] that are called pure? 1. The aspects of directly seeing; 2. Aspects based upon directly seeing; 3. Aspects drawn from analogy; 4. Aspects [which are] completely true; and 5. Aspects of well purified teaching.”

「現見所得相者，謂一切行皆無常性，一切行皆是苦性，一切法皆無我性，此為世間現量所得。如是等類，是名現見所得相。

“Aspects of directly seeing refer to the impermanent nature of all conditioned behavior (*saṃskāra*), the suffering nature of all conditioned behavior, the selfless nature of all conditioned behavior. These are directly experienced in the world. Things like this are what are called aspects of directly seeing.”

「依止現見所得相者，謂一切行皆剎那性，他世有性，淨不淨業無失壞性。由彼能依麁無常性，現可得故。由諸有情種種差別，依種種業現可得故，由諸有情若樂若苦，淨不淨業以為依止，現可得故。由此因緣，於不現見可為比度。如是等類，是名依止現見所得相。

“Aspects based upon directly seeing refer to the totally momentary (*kṣaṇa*) nature of all conditioned behavior, the nature of other worlds, and the nature of pure and impure karma not disappearing. Since these are based upon the coarse nature of impermanence, they are directly perceived. Since the various differences among sentient beings depend upon
their various karmic actions, they are directly perceived, and since the suffering or the
joy of sentient beings is based upon their pure or impure karmic actions, they are directly perceived. Things like this are called aspects based upon directly seeing.”

「自類譬喻所引相者，謂於內外諸行聚中，引諸世間共所了知所得生死以為譬喻，引諸世間共所了知所得生等種種苦相以為譬喻，引諸世間共所了知所得不自在相以為譬喻，又復於外引諸世間共所了知所得衰盛以為譬喻。如是等類，當知是名自類譬喻所引相。

Aspects drawn from analogy refers to drawing upon things commonly known in the world as analogies, like birth and death among the assemblages of inner and outer conditioned bindings, drawing upon things commonly known in the world as analogies, like the suffering of birth, etc., drawing upon things commonly known in the world as analogies, like not being sovereignly free, and also drawing upon commonly known examples in the world as analogies, such as the idea of wealth. Thing like this are called aspects drawn from analogy.”

「圓成實相者，謂即如是現見所得相，若依止現見所得相，若自類譬喻所得相，於所成立，決定能成，當知是名圓成實相。

Aspects [which are] completely true refer to the ability to definitively achieve what has been established either through the aspects of directly seeing, through the aspects of what are based upon directly seeing, or throughout aspects drawn from analogy. You should know, this is called aspects [which are] completely true.”

「善清淨言教相者，謂一切智者之所宣說，如言涅槃究竟寂靜，如是等類，當知是名善清淨言教相。

“Aspects of well purified teaching refers to what is said by all-knowing ones, such as that Nirvana is ultimate quiescence. This like this, you should know, are called aspects of well purified teaching.”

「善男子！是故由此五種相故，名善觀察清淨道理，由清淨故，應可修習。」

“Kulaputra! It is because of these five aspects, called pure logical reasoning good insight, and because they are pure they should be cultivated.”

曼殊室利菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！一切智相者，當知有幾種？」

Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! How many kinds of characteristics are there of an all-knowing one?”

佛告曼殊室利菩薩曰：「善男子！略有五種：一者、若有出現世間一切智聲，無不普聞；二者、成就三十二種大丈夫相；三者、具足十力，能斷一切眾生一切疑惑；四者、具足四無所畏宣說正法，不為一切他論所伏，而能摧伏一切邪論；五者、於善說法、毘奈耶中，八支聖道、四沙門等，皆現可得。如是生故，相故，斷疑網故，非他所伏能伏他故，聖道、沙門現可得故，如是五種，當知名為一切智相。

The Buddha replied to Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! In general, there are five kinds: 1. If the voice of an all-knowing one arises in the world, there is nowhere it will not be heard; 2. They achieve the thirty-two characteristics of a great person; 3. Being replete with the Ten Powers, they are able to cut off all the doubts of all sentient beings; 4. Being replete with the Four Fearlessnesses in their teaching of the Correct Dharma, irrefutable by the arguments of other, able to refute all false arguments; and 5. Being able to completely bring about the well spoken Dharma, the Vinaya, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the the four *śramaṇas*. Due to arising like this, due to these characteristics, due to cutting away the net of doubt, not being subject to refutation by others, but rather able to refute others, the Noble Path and *śramaṇas* appear. These five, you should know, are called characteristics of an all-knowing one.”

「善男子！如是證成道理，由現量故、由比量故、由聖教量故。由五種相，名為清淨。

“Kulaputra! Logical reasoning from realization like this, being directly experienced, being inferred, being wisely taught, these five kinds of characteristics are called pure.”

Characteristic 4.7.3.2 - Seven impure aspects of logical reasoning from realization

「云何由七種相名不清淨？一者、此餘同類可得相；二者、此餘異類可得相；三者、一切同類可得相；四者、一切異類可得相；五者、異類譬喻所得相；六者、非圓成實相；七者、非善清淨言教相。

“What are the seven kinds of characteristics that are called not pure” 1. Characteristics ascertained by similitude; 2. Characteristics ascertained by difference; 3. Characteristics ascertained by similitude to everything; 4. Characteristics ascertained by difference from everything; 5. Characteristics ascertained through differing analogies; 6. Characteristics that are not completely true; and 7. Characteristics not from well purified teachings.”

「若一切法意識所識性，是名一切同類可得相，若一切法相性業法因果異相，由隨如是一一異相，決定展轉各各異相，是名一切異類可得相。善男子！若於此餘同類可得相，及譬喻中有一切異類相者，由此因緣，於所成立非決定故，是名非圓成實相。又於此餘異類可得相，及譬喻中有一切同類相者，由此因緣，於所成立不決定故，亦名非圓成實相。非圓成實故，非善觀察清淨道理，不清淨故，不應修習。若異類譬喻所引相，若非善清淨言教相，當知體性皆不清淨。

“If all *dharmas* are thought of as being of the nature of consciousness, this is called characteristics ascertained by similitude. If the characteristics, natures, karmic actions, causes, results, and differentiations of all *dharmas* are thought of according to each of these different characteristics, this is certain to produce more individually different characteristics. This is called characteristics ascertained by difference. Kulaputra! If, in that which is ascertained by similitude, the characteristics different from everything are included by analogy, for this reason, what is proposed cannot be established. This is called characteristics that are not completely true. If, in that which is ascertained by difference from everything, characteristics similar to everything are included by analogy, what is proposed cannot be established. This is also called characteristics that are not completely true. Due to being incomplete, it negates well-understood, purified reasoning. Because impure, it cannot be cultivated. If its characteristics are drawn from dissimilar analogies, if it negates well-purified teaching, you should know, fundamentally it is impure.”

Characteristic 4.7.4

「法爾道理者，謂如來出世，若不出世，法性，安住、法住，法界，是名法爾道理。

“Logical reasoning according to natural law refers to the Dharmadhatu, which abides in all *dharmas* and supports the nature of dharmas, whether a Thus Come One appears in the world or not. This is called logical reasoning according to natural law.”

Characteristic 4.8

「總別者，謂先總說一句法已，後後諸句差別分別究竟顯了。

“Unity and difference refers to the ultimate understanding of what is at first explained generally by a single dharma and later differentiated and distinguished by many terms.”

Characteristic 5

「自性相者，謂我所說有行有緣，所有能取菩提分法，謂念住等，如是名為彼自性相。

“Characteristics of inherent nature [of the aids to awakening] refer to what I have explained concerning the practices and objects of the aids to awakening, which are the foundations of mindfulness, etc. This is what are known as the characteristics of inherent nature.

Characteristic 6

「彼果相者，謂若世間若出世間，諸煩惱斷，及所引發世出世間諸果功德，如是名為得彼果相。

“Characteristics of [karmic] results [of the aids to awakening] refer to the abandonment of all mundane and trans-mundane afflictions, and all the mundane and trans-mundane merit resultant therefrom. These are called characteristics of [karmic] results.”

Characteristic 7

「彼領受開示相者，謂即於彼，以解脫智而領受之，及廣為他宣說開示，如是名為彼領受開示相。

“Characteristics of explanations [of the aids to awakening] refers to experiencing them through liberating wisdom, and then broadly explaining them for others. This is called characteristics of explanations.”

Characteristic 8

「彼障礙法相者，謂即於修菩提分法，能隨障礙諸染污法，是名彼障礙法相。

“Characteristics of things that obstruct [the aids to awakening] refers to all defiled dharmas that are able to obstruct the cultivation of the aids to awakening. These are called characteristics of things that obstruct [the aids to awakening].”

Characteristic 9

「彼隨順法相者，謂即於彼多所作法，是名彼隨順法相。

Characteristics of things in accord [with the aids to awakening] refers to things that increase the doing of them. This is called characteristics of things in accord [with the aids to awakening].”

Characteristic 10

「彼過患相者，當知即彼諸障礙法所有過失，是名彼過患相。

Characteristics harmful [to the aids to awakening], you should know, are the errors of all the things that obstruct them. This is called characteristics harmful [to the aids to awakening].”

Characteristic 11

「彼勝利相者，當知即彼諸隨順法所有功德，是名彼勝利相。」

Characteristics that benefit [the aids to awakening], you should know, are the merit of all the things in accord with them. This is called the characteristics that benefit [the aids to awakening].”

曼殊室利菩薩復白佛言：「唯願世尊為諸菩薩略說契經、調伏、本母、不共外道陀羅尼義，由此不共陀羅尼義，令諸菩薩得入如來所說諸法甚深密意。」

Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “Would the World-Honored One please give a general explanation of the unique meaning of the *dhāraṇī*s on/of/for sutras, vinaya, and the originating mothers, not common to heretics, by which unique *dhāraṇī* meaning bodhisattvas attain entry into the deepest, underlying (’secret’) meaning of the Dharma expounded by the Thus Come One.”

佛告曼殊室利菩薩曰：「善男子！汝今諦聽，吾當為汝略說不共陀羅尼義，令諸菩薩，於我所說密意言詞能善悟入。

The Buddha replied to Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! Listen carefully and I will summarize for you the meaning of the unique *dhāraṇīs* by which bodhisattvas well penetrate the underlying meaning of what I have explained.”

「善男子！若雜染法、若清淨法，我說一切皆無作用，亦都無有補特伽羅，以一切種離所為故。非雜染法先染後淨，非清淨法後淨先染，凡夫異生，於麁重身，執著諸法、補特伽羅自性差別，隨眠妄見以為緣故，計我我所；由此妄見，謂我見、我聞、我嗅、我甞、我觸、我知、我食、我作、我染、我淨，如是等類邪加行轉。若有如實知如是者，便能永斷麁重之身，獲得一切煩惱不住，最極清淨，離諸戲論，無為依止，無有加行。善男子！當知是名略說不共陀羅尼義。」

“Kulaputra! Whether defiled *dharmas* or pure *dharmas*, I have explained that all are without purpose (function, use, activity), and are also without any *pudgala*, for everything is apart from
conditionality. There are no defiled *dharmas*, for it is not the case that they are first defiled and then purified. There are no pure *dharmas*, for it is not the case that what is later purified was previously defiled. Common people in their ‘coarse heavy’ bodies cling to *dharmas* and are passionate in regard to their false views, differentiating the inherent nature of a *pudgala*, they imagine an ‘I’ and a ‘mine.’ Due to this false view they say, ‘I see,’ ‘I hear,’ ‘I smell,’ ‘I taste,’ ‘I touch,’ ‘I know,’ ‘I eat,’ ‘I do,’
‘I am defiled,’ ‘I am purified.’ Like this, their perverse efforts persevere (*prayoga*). But if they knew things as they really are, then they would be able finally to abandon those ‘coarse heavy’ bodies and attain the unconditioned support that does not abide in afflictions, the highest purity apart from all verbal fabrication, and the unconditioned support without any persevering. Kulaputra! You should know, this is called a summary explanation of the meaning of unique *dhāraṇīs.”*

爾時，世尊欲重宣此義，而說頌曰：

At that time, the World-Honored One, wanting to emphasize the meaning of this, spoke in verse saying:

一切雜染清淨法，　　
皆無作用數取趣。　
由我宣說離所為，　　
染污清淨非先後。

All defiled and pure dharmas,
Are completely without function or repeated incarnations (*pudgala*).
As I explain, [everything is] apart from conditionality,
Defilement and purity are without before or after.

於麁重身隨眠見，　　
為緣計我及我所；　
由此妄謂我見等，　　
我食我為我染淨。

From the ‘coarse heaviness’ of the body follow stupefied views,
Imagining an “I” and a “mine.”
From this delusion of the view of a self, etc.
[They say] “I eat,” “I do,” “I am defiled or pure.”

若如實知如是者，　　
乃能永斷麁重身，　
得無染淨無戲論，　　
無為依止無加行。」

If one knows [things] as they really are,
And forever cuts off the ‘coarse heaviness’ of the body,
Attaining the unconditioned support apart from defilement or purification,
without verbal fabrication, without effort.

爾時，曼殊室利菩薩摩訶薩復白佛言：「世尊！云何應知諸如來心生起之相？」

At that time, Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva mahasattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! What should be understood as the characteristic of the arising of the mind of the Thus Come One?”

佛告曼殊室利菩薩曰：「善男子！夫如來者，非心意識生起所顯，然諸如來有無加行心法生起，當知此事猶如變化。」

The Buddha replied to Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! A Thus Come One is not to be described as having mind, thought, or consciousness that arises. Rather, Thus Come Ones all arise from mental states without perseverance (i.e. effortlessness). You should know, they are like illusory transformations.”

曼殊室利菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！若諸如來法身，遠離一切加行；既無加行，云何而有心法生起？」

Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva mahasattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! If the Dharma Body of all Thus Come Ones is apart from all effort (*prayoga*), being without effort, how does [such a] mental state arise?”

佛告曼殊室利菩薩曰：「善男子！先所修習方便般若加行力故，有心生起。善男子！譬如正入無心睡眠，非於覺悟而作加行，由先所作加行勢力而復覺悟。又如正在滅盡定中，非於起定而作加行，由先所作加行勢力，還從定起。如從睡眠及滅盡定心更生起，如是如來由先修習方便般若加行力故，當知復有心法生起。」

The Buddha replied to Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! Due to the power of the effort whereby they have previously cultivated the *prajñā* of *upaya*, there is the arising of mind. Kulaputra! It is just as one needs no effort to wake up after a deep, thoughtless sleep, for one awakens because of the power of efforts previously expended. Or, it is like needing no effort to arise from correct cessative concentration, for one returns because of the power of previous efforts. Just as one produces thoughts when arising from sleep or cessative concentration, you should know, like this, a Thus Come One gives rise to thoughts because of the power of the *prajñā* of *upaya* previously cultivated.”

曼殊室利菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！如來化身，當言有心為無心耶？」

Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! Should the transformation body of a Thus Come One be said to have mind, or be without mind?”

佛告曼殊室利菩薩曰：「善男子！非是有心，亦非無心。何以故？無自依心故，有依他心故。」

The Buddha replied to Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! It is not that there is mind, and also not without mind. How so? Due to being without an independent mind, and there being mind dependent upon others.”

曼殊室利菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！如來所行，如來境界，此之二種，有何差別？」

Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! The [sphere of] activity of the Thus Come One and the realm of the Thus Come One - what is the difference between these two?”

佛告曼殊室利菩薩曰：「善男子！如來所行，謂一切種，如來共有不可思議無量功德，眾所莊嚴清淨佛土。如來境界，謂一切種，五界差別。何等為五？一者、有情界；二者、世界；三者、法界；四者、調伏界；五者、調伏方便界。如是名為二種差別。」

The Buddha replied to Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! The [sphere of] activity of the Thus Come One refers to all kinds of pure Buddha Lands adorned with inconceivable, immeasurable merit, common to all Thus Come Ones. The realm of the Thus Come One refers to five different kinds of realms. What five? 1. The realm of sentient beings; 2. Worldly realms; 3. The Dharma Realm; 4. The realm of Discipline; and 5. The realm of disciplinary upaya. These are the differences between those two.”

曼殊室利菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！如來成等正覺、轉正法輪、入大涅槃，如是三種，當知何相？」

Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! What should be known as the characteristics of the Thus Come Ones correct awakening, turning of the wheel of the Correct Dharma, and entrance into the great Nirvana?”

佛告曼殊室利菩薩曰：「善男子！當知此三皆無二相。謂非成等正覺、非不成等正覺；非轉正法輪、非不轉正法輪；非入大涅槃、非不入大涅槃。何以故？如來法身究竟淨故，如來化身常示現故。」

The Buddha replied to Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! You should know, these three are characterized as being non-dual. Which is to say, there is no development of correct awakening, nor is there no development of correct awakening; There is no turning of the wheel of the Correct Dharma, nor is there not a turning of the wheel of the Correct Dharma; There is no entering the great Nirvana, nor is there no entering the great Nirvana. How so? Because of the ultimate purity of the Dharma Body of the Thus Come One, and because of the constant manifestation of the Thus Come One.”

曼殊室利菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！諸有情類，但於化身見聞奉事生諸功德，如來於彼有何因緣？」

Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! All kinds of sentient beings give rise to merit just from seeing, hearing, and making offerings to transformational bodies. How does the Thus Come One cause them [to do so]?”

佛告曼殊室利菩薩曰：「善男子！如來是彼增上所緣之因緣故。又彼化身，是如來力所住持故。」

The Buddha replied to Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! It is because the Thus Come One is the dominant condition for them. Also, because those transformational bodies are sustained through the power of the Thus Come One.”

曼殊室利菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！等無加行，何因緣故如來法身，為諸有情放大智光，及出無量化身影像？聲聞、獨覺解脫之身，無如是事？」

Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! How does the Dharma Body of the Thus Come One, without any effort, emit the great Light of Knowledge for all sentient beings, and produce the images of immeasurable transformational bodies? Why do the liberation bodies of voice-hearers and solitary awakened ones not ‘do things’ like this?”

佛告曼殊室利菩薩曰：「善男子！譬如等無加行，從日、月輪水火二種頗胝迦寶放大光明，非餘水火頗胝迦寶，謂大威德有情所住持故，諸有情業增上力故。又如從彼善工業者之所雕飾，末尼寶珠出印文像，不從所餘不雕飾者。如是緣於無量法界方便般若，極善修習磨瑩，集成如來法身，從是能放大智光明及出種種化身影像，非唯從彼解脫之身，有如斯事。」

The Buddha replied to Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! It is just like how, without effort, light is emitted from the sun and moon, and the two kinds of water and fire *sphaṭika* jewels, not other water and fire *sphaṭika* jewels, because they are sustained by sentient beings of great, magnanimous merit, and because the the karma of all sentient beings is the dominant power. It is also like the karma of a carving done by a skilled craftsperson, whose *maṇi* jewel pearls emit the images inscribed, but not from those not carved so. From conditions like this, through the extremely skillful cultivation and refinement of Prajñā and Upāya throughout the immeasurable Dharma Realm, the Dharma Body of Thus Come One comes together, and from this is able to cast the great light of knowledge and emit the images of all kinds of transformational bodies, but not from those liberation bodies alone are there such ‘things’.

曼殊室利菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！如世尊說：『如來、菩薩威德住持，令諸眾生於欲界中，生剎帝利、婆羅門等大富貴家，人身財寶無不圓滿，或欲界天、色、無色界，一切身財圓滿可得。』世尊！此中有何密意？」

Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! As the World-Honored One has said, ‘The sustaining righteousness of Tathagatas and bodhisattvas causes sentient beings in the Realm of Desire to be born among noble families of warriors and brahmins, their physical and material well-being lacking nothing, whether in the form of gods in the Realm of Desire, the Realm of Form, or the Formless Realm, they are able to attain perfection in their physical and material wellbeing.’ World-Honored One! What is the underlying (secret) meaning of this?”

佛告曼殊室利菩薩曰：「善男子！如來、菩薩威德住持，若道若行，於一切處，能令眾生獲得身財皆圓滿者，即隨所應，為彼宣說此道此行。若有能於此道此行正修行者，於一切處所獲身財無不圓滿。若有眾生於此道行違背輕毀，又於我所起損惱心及瞋恚心，命終已後，於一切處所得身財無不下劣。曼殊室利！由是因緣，當知如來及諸菩薩威德住持，非但能令身財圓滿，如來、菩薩住持威德，亦令眾生身財下劣。」

The Buddha replied to Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! The sustaining righteousness of Tathagatas and bodhisattvas, whether in terms of the Path or practice, is capable of leading sentient beings in all places to obtain perfection in their physical and material well-being. As appropriate, they preach the Path and its practice. Those who are able to, and actually do, correctly cultivate the Path and the practice will never lack for such perfection of their physical and material well-being. But for sentient beings who turn away from and reject the Path and its practice, and harbor thoughts of bitterness or anger, after their lives are over the physicality and material [well-being] they may have had will dwindle. Mañjuśrī! From these causes and conditions, you should know, not only that the righteous Tathagatas and bodhisattvas bring about physical and material well-being, but also how the dwindling of the body and riches comes about for sentient beings.”

曼殊室利菩薩復白佛言：「世尊！諸穢土中，何事易得？何事難得？諸淨土中，何事易得？何事難得？」

Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! In all defiled lands,  what are those things easy to find? What are those things difficult to find? In all pure lands, what are those things easy to find? What are those things difficult to find?

佛告曼殊室利菩薩曰：「善男子！諸穢土中，八事易得，二事難得。何等名為八事易得？一者、外道；二者、有苦眾生；三者、種姓家世興衰差別；四者、行諸惡行；五者、毀犯尸羅；六者、惡趣；七者、下乘；八者、下劣意樂加行菩薩。何等名為二事難得？一者、增上意樂加行菩薩之所遊集，二者、如來出現于世。曼殊室利！諸淨土中與上相違，當知八事甚為難得，二事易得。」

The Buddha replied to Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! In all defiled lands there are eight things easy to find and two things difficult to find. What are the eight things easy to find? 1. Outside ways (’heretics’); 2. Suffering sentient beings; 3. Differences in the rising and falling of houses of high lineage in the world; 4. The doing of evil actions; 5. The transgressing of *śīla*; 6. Evil rebirths; 7. The lesser vehicle(s); and 8. Bodhisattvas with inferior intentions and effort. What are the two things difficult to find? 1. An assembly of bodhisattvas with superior intentions and effort; and 2. The appearance of a Thus Come One in the world. Mañjuśrī! In pure lands, it is the exact opposite. You should know, those eight things are hard to find, and those two things are easy to find.”

爾時，曼殊室利菩薩白佛言：「世尊！於此解深密法門中，此名何教？我當云何奉持？」

At that time, Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! How should this Revealing the Secret Dharma Door be taught? How should we revere it?”

佛告曼殊室利菩薩曰：「善男子！此名如來成所作事了義之教，於此如來成所作事了義之教，汝當奉持。」

The Buddha replied to Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva saying, “Kulaputra! This is taught as the explicit meaning of the ’doings’ of the Thus Come One. You should revere it as the teaching on the explicit meaning of the ’doings’ of the Thus Come One”

說是如來成所作事了義教時，於大會中有七十五千菩薩摩訶薩，皆得圓滿法身證覺。

When this explicit meaning of the ’doings’ of the Thus Come One was spoken among the great assembly, there were seventy-five thousand great bodhisattvas who all realized the perfected the Dharma Body.

一時佛在毘耶離菴羅樹園，與大比丘眾八千人俱，菩薩三萬二千——眾所知識，大智本行，皆悉成就；諸佛威神之所建立，為護法城，受持正法；能師子吼，名聞十方；眾人不請，友而安之；紹隆三寶，能使不絕；降伏魔怨，制諸外道，悉已清淨，永離蓋纏；心常安住，無礙解脫；念、定、總持，辯才不斷；布施、持戒、忍辱、精進、禪定、智慧及方便力，無不具足；逮無所得不起法忍，已能隨順轉不退輪；善解法相，知眾生根；蓋諸大眾得無所畏、功德智慧，以修其心；相好嚴身，色像第一，捨諸世間所有飾好；名稱高遠，踰於須彌；深信堅固，猶若金剛；法寶普照，而雨甘露；於眾言音，微妙第一；深入緣起，斷諸邪見，有無二邊，無復餘習；演法無畏，猶師子吼，其所講說，乃如雷震，無有量，已過量；集眾法寶，如海導師，了達諸法深妙之義；善知眾生往來所趣及心所行；近無等等佛自在慧、十力、無畏、十八不共；關閉一切諸惡趣門，而生五道以現其身；為大醫王，善療眾病，應病與藥，令得服行；無量功德皆成就，無量佛土皆嚴淨；其見聞者，無不蒙益；諸有所作，亦不唐捐；如是一切功德、皆悉具足——

Once, the Buddha was in the Amra Gardens in the city of Vaiśālī, accompanied by a great assembly of leading monks numbering eight thousand. There were also thirty-two thousand bodhisattvas, all known to the assembly, persons who had car­ried out all the basic practices of great wisdom. Sustained by the might and supernatural power of the Buddhas, they accepted and upheld the correct Dharma in order to guard the citadel of the Dharma. They knew how to roar the lion's roar, and their names were heard throughout the Ten Directions. Without waiting to be asked, they befriended others and brought them comfort. They ensured the continuance and prosperity of the Three Treasures, making certain that these never expired. They conquered and subdued the ill will of Mara, and corrected erroneous ways, being already totally purified, having long ago rid themselves of bondage. Their minds constantly resided in a state of unhindered liberation [*apratihata-vimokṣa*]. Their mindfulness, medita­tion, retention, and eloquence were unbroken. Their Generosity, Discipline, Patience, Determination, Dhyana, Wisdom, and the power of Upaya (skillful means), none were not complete. Coming to the patience (*kshanti*) that there is nothing to be attained and that nothing (no dharma) arises, they were able to respond compliantly to others and to turn the non-regressing Wheel of the Dharma. Well comprehending the charac­teristics of all things (*dharmas*), they understand the capacities (faculties) of liv­ing beings. Towering over the others in the great assembly, by cultivating their minds they were without fear of anything, meritorious and wise. Their bodies were adorned with auspicious characteristics, their form and images foremost [#1, the best, perfect], having let go of all worldly embellishments [adornments and auspices]. Their fame and renown were as high and broad as Mt. Sumeru. Their profound faith was as firm as Vajra. The jewels of their Dharma shone everywhere, raining down the sweet dew. Among the assembly, the sound of their words was the most subtle and wonderful of all. They had plumbed the depths of Dependent Origination and cut off all erroneous views, no longer entertaining the concepts of either being or nonbeing. They explained the all encompassing Dharma fearlessly, as roaring lions, their explaining rolling forth like thunder, without measure, beyond measurement. In gathering Dharma jewels, they were like practiced pilots at sea, having all the pro­found and subtle meanings of the Dharma. They were excellent in perceiving the past and future existences of living beings and the habits (*samskara*, ‘workings’) of their minds. They came close to equaling the sovereign (independent, *isvara*) wisdom of the Buddha, the ten powers, the [four] fearless­nesses, and the eighteen unique *dharmas*. Though they had firmly closed the gate to all manner of evil existences, yet they allowed themselves to be born in the five lower realms, manifesting themselves there so that they might act as great physi­cian kings, adroitly healing the ills of others, giving what­ever medicine suited to the ailment, and insuring that the patient takes it as prescribed. Immeasurable merit — all they had acquired; Immeasurable Buddha lands — all they had made marvelously pure. No one saw or listened to them without profiting thereby, and no action of theirs was ever performed in vain. Such was the man­ner in which all merit adhered to them.

There were thirty-two thousand bodhisattvas such as these.

復有萬梵天王尸棄等，從餘四天下，來詣佛所，而聽法；復有萬二千天帝，亦從餘四天下，來在會坐；并餘大威力諸天、龍神、夜叉、乾闥婆、阿脩羅、迦樓羅、緊那羅、摩睺羅伽等，悉來會坐；諸比丘、比丘尼、優婆塞、優婆夷，俱來會坐。彼時佛與無量百千之眾，恭敬圍繞，而為說法，譬如須彌山王顯于大海，安處眾寶師子之座，蔽於一切諸來大眾。

There were also ten thousand Brahma kings, Shikhin and others, who had come from the other four-continent worlds to visit the place where the Buddha was and listen to the Dharma. There were also twelve thousand Indras who had come from the other four-continent worlds to take a seat in the gathering. In addition, there were other heavenly beings of great authority and power, as well as nagas, spirits, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kimnaras, mahoragas, and others, all who came to take a seat in the assembly. Also arrived to take seats in the assembly were the various monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.

At that time the Buddha, reverently surrounded by this mul­titude of countless hundreds and thousands of beings, explained the Dharma for them. He was like Mt. Sumeru, king of moun­tains, rising up out of the great sea. Resting at ease on his lion throne seat clustered with jewels, he shed his radiance over all the great throng gathered there.

爾時毘耶離城有長者子，名曰寶積，與五百長者子，俱持七寶蓋，來詣佛所，頭面禮足，各以其蓋共供養佛。佛之威神，令諸寶蓋合成一蓋，遍覆三千大千世界，而此世界廣長之相，悉於中現；又此三千大千世界諸須彌山、雪山、目真隣陀山、摩訶目真隣陀山、香山、寶山、金山、黑山、鐵圍山、大鐵圍山，大海江河，川流泉源，及日月星辰、天宮、龍宮、諸尊神宮，悉現於寶蓋中；又十方諸佛，諸佛說法，亦現於寶蓋中。爾時一切大眾。覩佛神力，歎未曾有！合掌禮佛，瞻仰尊顏，目不暫捨。於是長者子寶積即於佛前，以偈頌曰：

At that time, the son of a wealthy elder of the city of Vaiśālī named Ratnakūṭa (Jeweled Accumulation), along with five hundred other sons of wealthy elders, came to the place where the Buddha was, all of them bearing parasols adorned with the seven treasures, and bowed their heads in obeisance before the feet of the Buddha, each offering their parasols to the Buddha.

The Buddha with his supernatural powers then caused all the jeweled parasols to come together and form one single parasol that spread over the entire Three Thousand Great Thousand world- system, with all the vast features of those worlds manifest within it. All the Sumeru mountains of the three thousand great thousand world system, Snow Mountains, Muchilinda Mountains, Mahamuchilinda Mountains, Fragrant Mountains, Jeweled Mountains, Gold Mountains, Black Mountains, Iron Encircling Mountains, Great Iron Encircling Mountains, the huge seas, the rivers and watercourses, brooks and streams, fountains and springs, as well as the suns, moons, stars, constellations, heavenly palaces, dragon palaces, and the palaces of venerable spirits - all these were to be seen within the jeweled parasol. Also, the Buddhas of the ten directions, the Buddhas as they explain the Dharma -  these too were visible within the jeweled parasol.

At that time all the members of the great assembly, witness­ing this manifestation of the Buddha's supernatural power, sighed in admiration at what they had never seen before. Pressing their palms together, they made obeisance to the Buddha, gazing up in reverence at the face of the World-Honored One and never taking their eyes from it.

Then the elder’s son, Ratnakūṭa, in the pres­ence of the Buddha recited these verses of praise:

目淨脩廣如青蓮，　　
心淨已度諸禪定，　
久積淨業稱無量，　　
導眾以寂故稽首。

Eyes pure and broad like the blue lotus,
Mind pure, free in all Dhyana meditations,
Long have you accumulated pure karma and immeasurable fame
Guiding beings with quietude, therefore we bow our heads. 　

既見大聖以神變，　　
普現十方無量土，　
其中諸佛演說法，　　
於是一切悉見聞。

We have seen the great sage work miraculous transformations,
Showing us immeasurable lands in the Ten Directions,
Buddhas explaining the Dharma therein—
Every one of these we have seen and heard.

法王法力超群生，　　
常以法財施一切，　
能善分別諸法相，　　
於第一義而不動，　
已於諸法得自在，　　
是故稽首此法王。

The power of the Dharma King's Dharma surpasses all other beings,
Constantly bestowing Dharma riches on them all.
Skillfully he distinguishes the characteristics of all things (*dharmas*),
Never faltering in his grasp of the one great Truth.
You have learned to treat all things (*dharmas*) with sovereignty,
So we bow our heads to this Dharma King.

說法不有亦不無，　　
以因緣故諸法生，　
無我無造無受者，　　
善惡之業亦不亡。

You explain things (*dharmas*) as neither existing nor not existing;
Causes and conditions bring about their birth.
No "I," no doer, no recipient,
Yet good and bad karma never cease to function.

始在佛樹力降魔，　　
得甘露滅覺道成，　
已無心意無受行，　　
而悉摧伏諸外道。

Beneath the Buddha tree, you used your might to overpower Mara;
Gaining the sweet dew of Nirvana, you won your way to enlightenment.
Already free of thought, perception, and conditioning,
You refuted all external ways.

三轉法輪於大千，　　
其輪本來常清淨，　
天人得道此為證，　　
三寶於是現世間。

Three times you turned the Wheel of the Dharma in the Great Thousand world-system,
The wheel that from the first has always been pure.
Heavenly and human beings gained the way— this was proof of it;
The Three Treasures thereupon appeared in the world.

以斯妙法濟群生，　　
一受不退常寂然，　
度老病死大醫王，　　
當禮法海德無邊。

This wonderful Dharma brought rescue to many beings;
Embracing it, they never regress but dwell in constant quietude.
Great physician king, healer of old age, sick­ness and death,
We pay homage to the boundless virtues of your Ocean of Dharma;

毀譽不動如須彌，　　
於善不善等以慈，　
心行平等如虛空，　　
孰聞人寶不敬承。

Unmoved by acclamation or abuse, like Mt. Sumeru,
You have compassion in in equal measure upon the virtuous and the non-virtuous,
Equanimious in mind and action, like empty space,
Who, hearing this jewel of humankind, does not give respect?

今奉世尊此微蓋，　　
於中現我三千界，　
諸天龍神所居宮，　　
乾闥婆等及夜叉，
悉見世間諸所有，　　
十力哀現是化變，　
眾覩希有皆歎佛，　　
今我稽首三界尊。

Now we offer these little parasols to the World-Honored One,
And in them is revealed to us the Three Thou­sand (Great Thousand) worlds
All the palaces of gods, nagas, and spirits,
Kimnaras, yakshas, and all those other beings,
Everything that exists in the world we see—
The Ten-Powered One in pity manifests these miraculous transformations.
The assembly, seeing this rare sight, all praise the Buddha;
Now I bow my head to the Honored One of the three times (past, present and future).

大聖法王眾所歸，　　
淨心觀佛靡不欣，　
各見世尊在其前，　　
斯則神力不共法。

Great sage, Dharma King, refuge of the multi­tudes —
Observing the Buddha with purified mind, none who do not rejoice!
Each sees the World-Honored One standing right before them —
Such are the Buddha's spiritual powers, his unique qualities.

佛以一音演說法，　　
眾生隨類各得解，　
皆謂世尊同其語，　　
斯則神力不共法。

The Buddha preaches the Dharma with a single voice
Sentient beings each understand it according to their kind.
All believe the World-Honored One speaks the same words to all—
Such are spiritual powers, those unique qualities.

佛以一音演說法，　　
眾生各各隨所解，　
普得受行獲其利，　　
斯則神力不共法。

The Buddha preaches the Dharma with a single voice,
But each sentient being understands it their own way.
All undertake the Buddha's practices and gain benefit thereby—
Such are the spiritual powers, those unique qualities.

佛以一音演說法，　　
或有恐畏或歡喜，　
或生厭離或斷疑，　　
斯則神力不共法。

The Buddha preaches the Dharma with a single voice,
But to some it brings fear, to others delight and joy.
Some are moved to leave the world, some are freed of doubt—
Such are the spiritual powers, those unique qualities.

稽首十力大精進，　　
稽首已得無所畏，　
稽首住於不共法，　　
稽首一切大導師，　
稽首能斷眾結縛，　　
稽首已到於彼岸，　
稽首能度諸世間，　　
稽首永離生死道。

We bow our heads before the great determination (*virya*) of the ten-powered one,
We bow our heads before the one who has attained fearlessness,
We bow our heads before the one who dwells in unique qualities,
We bow our heads to the great Guide of all,
We bow our heads to the one able to cut off the bonds of the multitudes,
We bow our heads to the one who has crossed over to the other shore,
We bow our heads to the one capable of rescuing the world,
We bow our heads to the one who has forever escaped the path of birth and death.

悉知眾生來去相，　　
善於諸法得解脫，　
不著世間如蓮華，　　
常善入於空寂行，　
達諸法相無罣礙，　　
稽首如空無所依。

You understand the characteristics of the coming and going of all beings,
You have gained apt liberation from all things (*dharmas*).
Free of worldly attachments, like a lotus blossom,
Constantly you move within the realm of emptiness and quietude;
You have mastered the characteristic of all things (*dharmas*), without blocks or hindrances;
We bow our heads to that which is like the sky, depending upon nothing.

爾時長者子寶積說此偈已，白佛言：「世尊！是五百長者子，皆已發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，願聞得佛國土清淨，唯願世尊說諸菩薩淨土之行！」

When the elder’s son Ratnakūṭa had fin­ished reciting these verses, he addressed the Buddha, saying, "World-Honored One! These five hundred sons of elders have all set their minds on *anuttara-samyak-sambodhi* (supreme, unsurpassable enlightenment). They wish to hear how one can purify the Buddha lands. We beg the World-Honored One to explain the practices carried out by bodhisattvas in purifying the lands."

佛言：「善哉！寶積！乃能為諸菩薩，問於如來淨土之行。諦聽，諦聽！善思念之，當為汝說！」於是寶積及五百長者子受教而聽。

The Buddha said, "Excellent! Jeweled Accumulation! For the sake of the bodhisattvas you do right to ask the Thus Come One about the practices for purifying the lands. Listen well! Listen well! Consider well! I will now explain to you." Ratnakūṭa and the other five hundred sons of elders then made ready to listen to the teachings addressed to them.

佛言：「寶積！眾生之類是菩薩佛土。所以者何？菩薩隨所化眾生而取佛土，隨所調伏眾生而取佛土，隨諸眾生應以何國入佛智慧而取佛土，隨諸眾生應以何國起菩薩根而取佛土。所以者何？菩薩取於淨國，皆為饒益諸眾生故。譬如有人，欲於空地，造立宮室，隨意無礙；若於虛空，終不能成！菩薩如是，為成就眾生故，願取佛國，願取佛國者，非於空也。

The Buddha said, "Ratnakūṭa! The various kinds of sentient beings are in themselves the Buddha lands of the bodhisattvas. How so? Because it is by transforming various sentient beings to discipline (*vinaya*) that bodhisattvas acquire Buddha lands. It is by persuading various sentient beings and overcoming their objec­tions that bodhisattvas acquire Buddha lands. It is by inducing the various sentient beings to enter into the Wisdom of the Buddha in such-and-such a land that they acquire their Buddha lands. It is by inducing the various sentient beings to develop the capacity (faculty, *indriya*) for bodhisattva practices in such-and-such a land that they acquire their Buddha lands. How so? Because the bodhisattva's acquisition of a pure land is wholly due to having brought benefit to living beings. Suppose someone proposes to build a mansion on a plot of open land. They may do so as they wish without hindrance. But if one tries to build it in the emptiness of the sky, they will never be successful. It is the same with the bodhisattvas. It is because they wish to help others to achieve success that they take their vow to acquire Buddha lands. Their vow to acquire Buddha lands in not founded on nothing (i.e. not in vein).

「寶積當知！直心是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，不諂眾生來生其國；深心是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，具足功德眾生來生其國；菩提心是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，大乘眾生來生其國；布施是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，一切能捨眾生來生其國；持戒是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，行十善道滿願眾生來生其國；忍辱是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，三十二相莊嚴眾生來生其國；精進是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，勤修一切功德眾生來生其國；禪定是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，攝心不亂眾生來生其國；智慧是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，正定眾生來生其國；四無量心是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，成就慈悲喜捨眾生來生其國；四攝法是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，解脫所攝眾生來生其國；方便是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，於一切法方便無礙眾生來生其國；三十七道品是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，念處、正勤、神足、根、力、覺、道眾生來生其國；迴向心是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，得一切具足功德國土；說除八難是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，國土無有三惡八難；自守戒行、不譏彼闕是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，國土無有犯禁之名；十善是菩薩淨土，菩薩成佛時，命不中夭，大富梵行，所言誠諦，常以軟語，眷屬不離，善和諍訟，言必饒益，不嫉不恚，正見眾生來生其國。

「如是，寶積！菩薩隨其直心，則能發行；隨其發行，則得深心；隨其深心，則意調伏；隨意調伏，則如說行；隨如說行，則能迴向；隨其迴向，則有方便；隨其方便，則成就眾生；隨成就眾生，則佛土淨；隨佛土淨，則說法淨；隨說法淨，則智慧淨；隨智慧淨，則其心淨；隨其心淨，則一切功德淨。是故寶積！若菩薩欲得淨土，當淨其心；隨其心淨，則佛土淨。」

“Like this, Ratnakūṭa! Bodhisattvas, being in accord with an upright mind, are capable of generating action (i.e. generating *bodhicitta*); from this generation of action they attain a profound mind; from this profound mind they master (tame, control) cognition; from the mastery of cognition they act as has been explained; from acting as has been explained they are capable of transferring [merit]; from their transference [of merit] they have skillful means (*upaya*); from their skillful means they develop sentient beings; from their development of sentient beings, their buddha land is pure; from the purity of their buddha land they are able to explain the Dharma purely (clearly); from explaining the Dharma purely, their Wisdom is pure; from the purity of their wisdom, their mind is pure; from the purity of their mind, all merit is pure.”

“Like this, Ratnakūṭa! If bodhisattvas wish to attain a pure land, they must purify their mind; if the mind is pure then it is a pure Buddha land.”

爾時舍利弗承佛威神作是念：「若菩薩心淨，則佛土淨者，我世尊本為菩薩時，意豈不淨，而是佛土不淨若此？」

At that time Śāriputra, moved by the Buddha's spiritual powers, thought to himself: "If the bodhisattva’s mind is pure, then their buddha land will be pure. When our World-Honored One first became a bodhisattva, surely the intention was pure. Why then is this Buddha land so filled with impurities?

佛知其念，即告之言：「於意云何？日月豈不淨耶？而盲者不見。」

The Buddha, knowing his thoughts, replied to him saying, “What do you think? Are the sun and moon impure if a blind person does not see them?

對曰：「不也，世尊！是盲者過，非日月咎。」

He [Śāriputra] replied, “No, World-Honored One! It is the fault of the blind person, the sun and moon and not to blame.”

「舍利弗！眾生罪故，不見如來佛土嚴淨，非如來咎；舍利弗！我此土淨，而汝不見。」

“Śāriputra! It is because of the failings of sentient beings that they do not see the purely adorned buddha land of the Thus Come One. The Thus Come one is not to blame. Śāriputra! I have purified this land, but you do not see it.”

爾時螺髻梵王語舍利弗：「勿作是意，謂此佛土以為不淨。所以者何？我見釋迦牟尼佛土清淨，譬如自在天宮。」

Then, the Brahma King Conch Topknot said to Śāriputra, "You must not have the thought, that ‘this Buddha land is impure’. Why? I see the purity of Śākyamuni’s Buddha land, like a sovereign heavenly palace."

舍利弗言：「我見此土丘陵坑坎、荊蕀沙礫、土石諸山、穢惡充滿。」

Śāriputra replied, “When I look at this land, I see it full of knolls and hollows, thorny underbrush, sand and gravel, dirt, rocks, many mountains, filth and defilement.”

螺髻梵王言：「仁者心有高下，不依佛慧，故見此土為不淨耳！舍利弗！菩薩於一切眾生，悉皆平等，深心清淨，依佛智慧，則能見此佛土清淨。」

Brahma King Conch Topknot said, "The Venerable’s mind has highs and lows, not resting on the Wisdom of the Buddha, therefore you see this land as impure. Śāriputra! Bodhisattvas treat all things and all beings, each one of them, with perfect equality, their profound mind is pure, resting on the Wisdom of the Buddha, thus they are able to see purity of this Buddha land."

於是佛以足指按地，即時三千大千世界，若干百千珍寶嚴飾，譬如寶莊嚴佛，無量功德寶莊嚴土，一切大眾歎未曾有！而皆自見坐寶蓮華。佛告舍利弗：「汝且觀是佛土嚴淨？」

The Buddha then [unfolded his legs and] pressed his [big] toe against the ground, and immediately the Three Thousand Great Thousand world system was adorned with hundreds and thousands of rare jewels, till it resembled Jeweled Adornment Buddha's Jeweled Adornment Buddha Land of Immeasur­able Blessings. All the members of the great assembly sighed in wonder at what they had never seen before! And they all saw themselves seated on jeweled lotuses.

The Buddha said to Śāriputra, "Now do you see the purely adorned Buddha Land?"

舍利弗言：「唯然，世尊！本所不見，本所不聞，今佛國土嚴淨悉現。」

Śāriputra replied, "Indeed I do, World-Honored One! Some­thing I have never seen before, and never even heard of before, now all the pure adornments of the Buddha land are visible before me."

佛語舍利弗：「我佛國土常淨若此，為欲度斯下劣人故，示是眾惡不淨土耳！譬如諸天，共寶器食，隨其福德，飯色有異。如是，舍利弗！若人心淨，便見此土功德莊嚴。」

The Buddha said to Śāriputra, "My Buddha land has always been pure like this. But, because I wish to rescue those who are lowly and inferior, it only appears to be an impure land full of defilement, that is all. It is like with heavenly beings. All take their food from the same precious vessel, but the food looks different for each one them, depending upon the merits and virtues that each possesses. It is the same in this case, Śāriputra! If someone’s mind is pure, then they will see this land’s miraculous adornments of merit.”

當佛現此國土嚴淨之時，寶積所將五百長者子皆得無生法忍，八萬四千人皆發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心。佛攝神足，於是世界還復如故；求聲聞乘三萬二千天及人，知有為法皆悉無常，遠塵離垢，得法眼淨；八千比丘，不受諸法，漏盡意解。

When the Buddha revealed the marvelous purity of the land, the five hundred sons of elders who accompanied Ratnakūṭa all attained the patient tolerance for the birthlessness of all things (*anutpattikadharmakṣānti*), and eighty-four thousand people generated ***anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta.***

The Buddha then released the supernatural power that he had exercised with his [big] toe, and the world returned to its former appearance. Thirty-two thousand heavenly and human beings who wished to pursue the path of *śrāvaka*s, understanding that all things are impermanent in nature, cast off the dust from their eyes, removed themselves from defilement, and attained the pure Dharma Eye; and eight thousand monks, ceasing to accept the phenomenal world, put an end to all outflows and gained liberation of mind.
## CHAPTER TWO - *UPAYA*

方便品第二
Chapter Two - *Upāya*

爾時毘耶離大城中有長者，名維摩詰，已曾供養無量諸佛，深植善本，得無生忍；辯才無礙，遊戲神通，逮諸總持；獲無所畏，降魔勞怨；入深法門，善於智度，通達方便，大願成就；明了眾生心之所趣，又能分別諸根利鈍，久於佛道，心已純淑，決定大乘；諸有所作，能善思量；住佛威儀，心大如海，諸佛咨嗟！弟子、釋、梵、世主所敬。

At that time, in the great city of Vaiśālī there was an elder named Vimalakīrti. He had already offered alms to immeasurable Buddhas in the past, had deeply planted roots of goodness, and had grasped the patient tolerance of birthlessness. Unhindered in eloquence, he roamed in the transcendental powers, and commanded full retention of the teachings. He had attained the state of fearlessness, over­coming the torments and ill will of Mara. He had entered the profound Dharma Doors and excelled in transcendent Wisdom (*Prajñāpāramitā*), a master of *upāya*, expedient means, he had successfully fulfilled the great vow. He could clearly discern the tendencies of the minds of sentient beings, and was also capable of distinguishing their capacities (faculties, *indriya*), keen or obtuse. His mind having long been clear and purified through the Way of the Buddha and he was firmly on the Great Vehicle. Everything he did was well thought out and planned. He abided with the dignity and authority of a Buddha, his mind as vast as an ocean, and all the Buddhas sighed in admiration! Disciples, Śakra, Brahmā, World Leaders, all praised him.

欲度人故，以善方便，居毘耶離；資財無量，攝諸貧民；奉戒清淨，攝諸毀禁；以忍調行，攝諸恚怒；以大精進，攝諸懈怠；一心禪寂，攝諸亂意；以決定慧，攝諸無智；雖為白衣，奉持沙門清淨律行；雖處居家，不著三界；示有妻子，常修梵行；現有眷屬，常樂遠離；雖服寶飾，而以相好嚴身；雖復飲食，而以禪悅為味；若至博弈戲處，輒以度人；受諸異道，不毀正信；雖明世典，常樂佛法；一切見敬，為供養中最；執持正法，攝諸長幼；一切治生諧偶，雖獲俗利，不以喜悅；遊諸四衢，饒益眾生；入治政法，救護一切；入講論處，導以大乘；入諸學堂，誘開童蒙；入諸婬舍，示欲之過；入諸酒肆，能立其志；若在長者，長者中尊，為說勝法；若在居士，居士中尊，斷其貪著；若在剎利，剎利中尊，教以忍辱；若在婆羅門，婆羅門中尊，除其我慢；若在大臣，大臣中尊，教以正法；若在王子，王子中尊，示以忠孝；若在內官，內官中尊，化政宮女；若在庶民，庶民中尊，令興福力；若在梵天，梵天中尊，誨以勝慧；若在帝釋，帝釋中尊，示現無常；若在護世，護世中尊，護諸眾生。長者維摩詰，以如是等無量方便饒益眾生。

Desiring to rescue others, he lived in Vaiśālī as an expedient (*upaya*). With his immeasurable wealth he embraced the poor and helpless. His faultless observation of the precepts (*sila*) embraced all [those] violating prohibitions. Through the practice of patient tolerance, he embraced all rage and anger. With great determination (*virya*) he embraced all laziness. Single-minded in *dhyanic* meditation, he embraced all chaotic thought. With firm, certain Wisdom he embraced all ignorance.

Though dressed in [the] white robes [of a layman], he observed all the rules of pure conduct laid down for monks, and though he lived at home, he had no attachment to the Triple World. One could see he had a wife and children, yet he always practiced the Pure Way of Brahma **(celibacy). It was obvious he had kin and household attendants, yet he always delighted in withdrawing from them. Although he wore jewels and finery, he was really adorned with the auspicious marks. Although he ate and drank like others, the joy of dhyana meditation is what he truly savored.

If he visited gambling parlors, it was solely to rescue people. If he received some other teaching, it did not impinge upon his true faith. Though well versed in secular writings, he constantly delighted in Buddha Dharma. Respected by everyone, he was looked on as foremost among those deserving of alms. Upholding the correct Dharma, he embraced old and young alike. He conducted all kinds of business enterprises in the spirit of trust and harmony, with no delight in worldly profit. He frequented the busy crossroads in order to bring benefit to others. He entered government offices and courts of law so as to aid and rescue all those he could. He entered places of debate in order to guide others to the Great Vehicle. He entered all the study halls to further the instruction of the students. He entered all houses of licentiousness to point out the errors of desire. And he entered wine shops in order to encourage those capable of ‘standing up’.

If among elders, he was the elder most revered, for explaining the superior Dharma. If among lay believers, he was the lay believer most revered, for having cut off all their greed and attachments. If among kṣatriya warriors, he was the kṣatriya most revered, for teaching them patient tolerance (*kshanti*). If among Brahmans he was the Brahman most revered, for ridding them of the conceit of ‘self’. If among great ministers he was the great minister most revered, for teaching the Correct Dharma. If among princes he was the prince most revered, for demonstrating loyalty and obedience. If among the inner palace, he was the inner palace member most revered, for converting and bringing refinement to the women [of the harem/inner palace]. If among common people, he was the common person most revered, for helping them gain wealth and power. If in Brahma’s heavens he was the most revered in Brahma’s heaven, for revealing superior Wisdom. If in Śakra’s [heaven] he was the most revered in Śakra’s [heaven], for demonstrating (pointing out, explaining) impermanence. If among the guardians of the world he was the most revered among the guardians of the world, for guarding all sentient beings.

The elder Vimalakirti, thus employed immeasurable numbers of *upāya* in order to bring benefit to others.

其以方便，現身有疾。以其疾故，國王大臣、長者居士、婆羅門等，及諸王子并餘官屬，無數千人，皆往問疾。其往者，維摩詰因以身疾，廣為說法：「諸仁者！是身無常、無強、無力、無堅、速朽之法，不可信也！為苦、為惱，眾病所集。諸仁者！如此身，明智者所不怙；是身如聚沫，不可撮摩；是身如泡，不得久立；是身如炎，從渴愛生；是身如芭蕉，中無有堅；是身如幻，從顛倒起；是身如夢，為虛妄見；是身如影，從業緣現；是身如響，屬諸因緣；是身如浮雲，須臾變滅；是身如電，念念不住；是身無主，為如地；是身無我，為如火；是身無壽，為如風；是身無人，為如水；是身不實，四大為家；是身為空，離我我所；是身無知，如草木瓦礫；是身無作，風力所轉；是身不淨，穢惡充滿；是身為虛偽，雖假以澡浴衣食，必歸磨滅；是身為災，百一病惱；是身如丘井，為老所逼；是身無定，為要當死；是身如毒蛇、如怨賊、如空聚，陰界諸入所共合成。

Using these *upāya*, he made it appear that his body was ill. Because of his illness, the king of the country, the great ministers, elders, lay believers, and Brahmans, as well as the princes and lesser officials, numbering countless thousands, all went to see him and inquire about his illness.

Vimalakirti then used this bodily illness to explain the Dharma to those who came. "Friends! This body is imperma­nent, without durability, without strength, without firmness, a thing that decays in a moment, not to be relied upon! It leads to suffering, affliction, a meeting place of manifold ills.

Friends! A body like this, no enlightened person could rely upon. This body is like a cluster of foam, noth­ing you can grasp or handle. This body is like a bubble that can­ not continue for very long. This body is like a flame born of longing and desire. This body is like a plantain tree that has no firmness in its trunk. This body is like a phantom, the product of error and confusion. This body is like a dream, compounded of false and empty visions. This body is like a shadow, appearing only through karmic causes. This body is like an echo, tied to causes and condi­tions. This body is like a drifting cloud, changing and vanishing in an instant. This body is like lightning, barely lasting from moment to moment. This body is like the earth element, which has no subjective being. This body is like the fire element, devoid of self. This body is like the wind element, which has no set life span. This body is like the water element, devoid of individuality. This body has no reality but makes these four elements its lodging. This body is empty, removed from self and the possessions of self. This body is without understanding, like plants or trees, tiles or pebbles. This body is without agency, blown about by the wind. This body is impure, crammed with defile­ment and evil. This body is vacuous and unreal, though you may bathe and cleanse it for a time, clothe and feed it, in the end it must crumble and fade. This body is plague-ridden, beset by a hundred and one ills and anxieties. This body is like an abandoned well on the hillside, old age pressing in on it. This body has no fixity, but is destined for certain death. This body is like poiso­nous snakes, vengeful bandits, or an empty village, a mere com­ing together of aggregates, realms, and sense-fields.

「諸仁者！此可患厭，當樂佛身。所以者何？佛身者即法身也；從無量功德智慧生，從戒、定、慧、解脫、解脫知見生，從慈、悲、喜、捨生，從布施、持戒、忍辱、柔和、勤行精進、禪定、解脫、三昧、多聞、智慧諸波羅蜜生，從方便生，從六通生，從三明生，從三十七道品生，從止觀生，從十力、四無所畏、十八不共法生，從斷一切不善法、集一切善法生，從真實生，從不放逸生；從如是無量清淨法生如來身。諸仁者！欲得佛身、斷一切眾生病者，當發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心。」

“Friends! A thing like this is irksome and hateful, and therefore you should desire the body of a Buddha. Why? Because the body of a Buddha is the *Dharmakaya*, the Dharma Body. It is born from immeasurable merits and wisdom. It is born from precepts, meditation, wis­dom, liberation, and the insights of liberation. It is born of kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity. It is born of the various *pāramitās*: generosity, discipline, patience, determination, meditation, liberation, samadhi, all the teachings, and Wisdom. It is born from *upāya*. It is born from the six supernatural powers. It is born from the thirty-seven aids to Awakening. Born from right observation. Born from the ten powers. Born from the four fearlessnesses. Born from the eighteen unique dharmas [of a Buddha]. Born from cutting off all unvirtuous dharmas. Born from gathering all virtuous dharmas. Born from the Truth of Suchness. Born from the avoidance of indulgence and laxity. Born from immeasurable, pure Dharma like this, is the body of the Thus Come One.

Friends! If you want to attain the body of a buddha and cut off all the illnesses of sentient beings, you should generate ***anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta*** (the highest, most correctly awakened mind, ‘bodhicitta’).”  ******

是長者維摩詰，為諸問疾者，如應說法，令無數千人皆發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心。

So, the elder Vimalakirti used the occasion of those coming to inquire about ***his*** illness to explain the Dharma, causing numberless thousands of people to all generate ***anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta.***
## CHAPTER THREE - THE DISCIPLES

弟子品 第三
Chapter Three - The Disciples

[爾時長者維摩詰，自念：「寢疾于床，世尊大慈，寧不垂愍？」

At that time, the elder Vimalakīrti thought to himself: "I am lying here sick in bed. Why does the World-Honored One in his great compassion not show concern for me?"

[Śāriputra](https://www.notion.so/riputra-9183e620e9b1410688f8558a09502913?pvs=21)

佛知其意，即告舍利弗：「汝行詣維摩詰問疾。」

The Buddha, aware of this thought, said to Śāriputra, "You should go visit Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness.”

舍利弗白佛言：「世尊！我不堪任詣彼問疾。所以者何？憶念我昔，曾於林中宴坐樹下，時維摩詰來謂我言：『唯，舍利弗！不必是坐，為宴坐也。夫宴坐者，不於三界現身意，是為宴坐；不起滅定而現諸威儀，是為宴坐；不捨道法而現凡夫事，是為宴坐；心不住內亦不在外，是為宴坐；於諸見不動，而修行三十七品，是為宴坐；不斷煩惱而入涅槃，是為宴坐。若能如是坐者，佛所印可。』時我，世尊！聞說是語，默然而止，不能加報！故我不任詣彼問疾。」

Śāriputra replied to the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! I couldn’t bare to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? I remember, once in the past, when I was sitting in peaceful meditation under a tree in the forest. At that time Vimalakirti approached and said to me, 'Ah, Śāriputra! You should not take this [sort of] sitting as peaceful sitting! Peaceful sitting means that in this threefold world you manifest neither body nor mind. This is peaceful sitting. Not rising out of samādhi of complete cessation and yet showing yourself in the ceremonies of daily life, this is peaceful sitting. Not abandoning the Way of the Dharma, yet showing yourself in common activities, this is peaceful sitting. The mind not fixed on internal things and yet not engaged with externals either, this is peaceful sitting. Unmoved by different views, yet practicing the thirty-seven aids to Awakening, this is peaceful sitting. Entering nirvana without having put an end to worldly desires, this is peaceful sitting. If you can sit like this, you will earn the Buddha's seal [*mudra*] of approval.”

World-Honored One! When I heard him say these words, I stood silent, unable to respond! For this reason, I cannot bare to inquire about his illness.”

[Mahāmaudgalyāyana](https://www.notion.so/Maudgaly-yana-or-Mah-maudgaly-yana-d801cba8b8a24743966f79a032c16404?pvs=21)

佛告大目犍連：「汝行詣維摩詰問疾。」

The Buddha said to Mahāmaudgalyāyana, “You should go visit Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness.”

目連白佛言：「世尊！我不堪任詣彼問疾。所以者何？憶念我昔入毘耶離大城，於里巷中為諸居士說法。時維摩詰來謂我言：『唯，大目連！為白衣居士說法，不當如仁者所說。夫說法者，當如法說。法無眾生，離眾生垢故；法無有我，離我垢故；法無壽命，離生死故；法無有人，前後際斷故；法常寂然，滅諸相故；法離於相，無所緣故；法無名字，言語斷故；法無有說，離覺觀故；法無形相，如虛空故；法無戲論，畢竟空故；法無我所，離我所故；法無分別，離諸識故；法無有比，無相待故；法不屬因，不在緣故；法同法性，入諸法故；法隨於如，無所隨故；法住實際，諸邊不動故；法無動搖，不依六塵故；法無去來，常不住故；法順空，隨無相，應無作；法離好醜，法無增損，法無生滅，法無所歸；法過眼耳鼻舌身心；法無高下，法常住不動，法離一切觀行。唯，大目連！法相如是，豈可說乎？夫說法者，無說無示；其聽法者，無聞無得。譬如幻士，為幻人說法。當建是意，而為說法。當了眾生根有利鈍，善於知見無所罣礙，以大悲心讚于大乘，念報佛恩不斷三寶，然後說法。』維摩詰說是法時，八百居士發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心。我無此辯，是故不任詣彼問疾。」

Maudgalyāyana replied to the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! I couldn’t bare to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? I remember once, in the past, I entered the great city of Vaiśālī and in its streets and lanes explaining the Dharma for the lay believers. At that time Vimalakirti approached and said to me, 'Ah, Mahāmaudgalyāyana! You should not explain the Dharma for the white-robed lay believers as the Venerable is explaining. One explaining the Dharma should explain like the Dharma.’

‘The Dharma is without sentient beings for being free from the defilement of sentient being(s). The Dharma is without an existent self for being free from the defilement of the self. The Dharma is without lifespan for being free from birth & death. The Dharma is without an existent individual for having severed connection to past and future. The Dharma is in constant stillness for having extinguished all characteristics. The Dharma is free of characteristics for being without anything conditional. The Dharma is without names and letters for having severed all [connection to] speech and language. The Dharma is inexplicable for being free from conceptualization. The Dharma is without characteristics for being like empty space. The Dharma is without idle imaginations (*prapañca*) for being ultimately empty. The Dharma is without any ‘mine’ for being free of [the duality ‘me’ and] ‘mine’. The Dharma is without differentiation for being free of all consciousness. The Dharma is without comparison for not having any characteristics to grab. The Dharma is not caused for not having location or condition. The Dharma is that nature of Dharmas for entering all things (dharmas). The Dharma conforms with Thusness for there is nothing else to conform to. The Dharma abides at the Limit of Reality for being unmoved by anything on the periphery. The Dharma is immovable for not depending on the ‘Six Dusts’ (six sense media). The Dharma is without coming or going for it never abides anywhere to begin with. The Dharma is in accord with emptiness, in accord with characteristiclessness, in accord with desirelessness [without the desire for outcomes]. The Dharma is free from beauty and ugliness. The Dharma is without increase or decrease. The Dharma is without arising and ceasing. The Dharma is without destination. The Dharma transcends eyes, ears, the nose, tongue, body, and mind. The Dharma is without high or low. The Dharma constantly abides, without moving. The Dharma is beyond the practice of all contemplation.’

 'Ah, Mahāmaudgalyāyana! The Dharma being characterized thus, how could it be explained? Explaining the Dharma means not explaining, not demonstrating. Listen­ing to the Dharma means not listening, not grasping. It is like an illlusionist creating the illusion of someone explaining the Dharma. It is with this understanding that you should explain the Dharma. You should understand the capacities of living beings, keen and dull, and cultivate virtuous insight free from all impediments, with a mind steeped in great compassion, praise the Great Vehicle, and remember the debt of gratitude you owe the Buddha, never allowing the Three Treasures to come to an end, then you may explain the Dharma.’

“When Vimalakirti explained the Dharma like this, eight hundred lay believers generated ***anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta.*** I do not have such eloquence as this. For this reason, I cannot bare to go inquire about his illness.”

[Mahākāśyapa](https://www.notion.so/K-yapa-or-Mah-k-yapa-ce6014ce01304c31987de2e3b43c05a4?pvs=21)

佛告大迦葉：「汝行詣維摩詰問疾。」

The Buddha said to Mahākāśyapa, “You should go visit Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness.”

迦葉白佛言：「世尊！我不堪任詣彼問疾。所以者何？憶念我昔，於貧里而行乞，時維摩詰來謂我言：『唯，大迦葉！有慈悲心而不能普捨豪富，從貧乞。迦葉！住平等法，應次行乞食；為不食故，應行乞食；為壞和合相故，應取揣食；為不受故，應受彼食；以空聚想，入於聚落；所見色與盲等，所聞聲與響等，所嗅香與風等，所食味不分別，受諸觸如智證，知諸法如幻相；無自性，無他性；本自不然，今則無滅。迦葉！若能不捨八邪、入八解脫，以邪相入正法；以一食施一切，供養諸佛，及眾賢聖，然後可食；如是食者，非有煩惱，非離煩惱；非入定意，非起定意；非住世間，非住涅槃。其有施者，無大福，無小福；不為益，不為損，是為正入佛道，不依聲聞。迦葉！若如是食，為不空食人之施也。』時我，世尊！聞說是語，得未曾有，即於一切菩薩，深起敬心，復作是念：『斯有家名，辯才智慧乃能如是！其誰聞此不發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心？』我從是來，不復勸人以聲聞、辟支佛行。是故不任詣彼問疾。」

Kāśyapa replied to the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! I couldn’t bare to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? I remember, in the past, I was begging for alms-food in a poor village. At that time Vimalakirti approached and said to me, 'Ah, Mahākāśyapa! You have a mind of loving-kindness and compassion, but you are unable to universally let go of poverty and wealth, and you beg out of poverty.’

‘Kāśyapa! You should beg for alms-food abiding in [*Upeksha*] the Dharma of Equanimity . There being no [such thing as] food, that is how you should beg for food.  Destroying the characteristic of unified entities, that is how you should accept clumps of food. Not accepting any thing, that is how you should accept food. Enter villages with the thought that they are empty villages. See all form(s) [*rupa*] as though blind; hear all sounds as echoes; smell all scents as the wind; taste all flavors as being undifferintiated; feel all textures as Realized Knowledge; and think of all things [*dharmas*] as illusory - without self-nature, without other-nature, unarisen from the beginning and therefore without cessation.’

‘Kāśyapa! If you are able to enter the Eight Liberations and not relinquish the eight errors, you enter the correct Dharma ***through the characteristic of error***. If, by one given meal, you can feed everyone, and make offerings to all Buddhas, sages and worthy persons, then you can eat. Eating like this is neither with defilement nor free of defilement; it neither enters a meditative state of mind nor arises out of a meditative state of mind; it abides neither in the world nor in Nirvana. One who gives like this gains no great fortune nor little fortune; gains neither profit nor loss; thereby correctly entering the Way of the Buddha, not relying on what has been heard [i.e. the path of the voice-hearer, the *śrāvakas*].’

‘Kāśyapa! Eating like this is not eating food that others give you in vain.’

“World-Honored One! When I heard him say these words, I gained what I had never had before, and I was inspired with a profound respect for all the bodhisattvas. And I thought to myself, 'This householder possesses such eloquence and wisdom and can speak like this! Who could listen to him without generating ***anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta***?’ From then on, I ceased to urge others to follow the path of the voice-hearers or *pratyekabuddhas* (solitary awakened ones). For this reason, I cannot bare to go inquire about his illness.”

[Subhūti](https://www.notion.so/Subh-ti-0f914f300ffb404da728b7dbcc8c05e2?pvs=21)

佛告須菩提：「汝行詣維摩詰問疾。」

The Buddha said to Subhūti, “You should go visit Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness.”

須菩提白佛言：「世尊！我不堪任詣彼問疾。所以者何？憶念我昔，入其舍，從乞食，時維摩詰取我鉢，盛滿飯，謂我言：『唯，須菩提！若能於食等者，諸法亦等，諸法等者，於食亦等；如是行乞，乃可取食。若須菩提不斷婬怒癡，亦不與俱；不壞於身，而隨一相；不滅癡愛，起於明脫；以五逆相而得解脫，亦不解不縛；不見四諦，非不見諦；非得果，非不得果；非凡夫，非離凡夫法；非聖人，非不聖人；雖成就一切法，而離諸法相，乃可取食。若須菩提不見佛，不聞法，彼外道六師：富蘭那迦葉、末伽梨拘賒梨子、刪闍夜毘羅胝子、阿耆多翅舍欽婆羅、迦羅鳩馱迦旃延、尼犍陀若提子等，是汝之師。因其出家，彼師所墮，汝亦隨墮，乃可取食。若須菩提入諸邪見，不到彼岸；住於八難，不得無難；同於煩惱，離清淨法；汝得無諍三昧，一切眾生亦得是定；其施汝者，不名福田；供養汝者，墮三惡道；為與眾魔共一手作諸勞侶，汝與眾魔，及諸塵勞，等無有異；於一切眾生而有怨心，謗諸佛、毀於法，不入眾數，終不得滅度。汝若如是，乃可取食。』時我，世尊！聞此語茫然，不識是何言？不知以何答？便置鉢欲出其舍。維摩詰言：『唯，須菩提！取鉢勿懼。於意云何？如來所作化人，若以是事詰，寧有懼不？』我言：『不也！』維摩詰言：『一切諸法，如幻化相，汝今不應有所懼也。所以者何？一切言說不離是相；至於智者，不著文字，故無所懼。何以故？文字性離，無有文字，是則解脫；解脫相者，則諸法也。』維摩詰說是法時，二百天子得法眼淨，故我不任詣彼問疾。」

Subhūti replied to the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! I couldn’t bare to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? I remember, in the past, I went to his house to beg for alms-food. "At that time Vimalakirti took my begging bowl, filled it with things to eat, and said, 'Ah, Subhūti, if one is able to regard all food as equal, all things [*dharmas*] are equal as well; one who regards all things as equal, regards food the same way; practicing begging like this, one can accept food.”

“If, Subhūti, you do not severe sensual desire, anger, and ignorance, and are also not associated with them; do not destroy the body, yet are in accord with the single characteristic; do not extinguish ignorance and longing, yet give rise to enlightenment and liberation; attain liberation by the characteristics of the five transgressions, yet are neither liberated nor bound; do not see the Four Noble Truths, yet do not *not* see the Truth; do not attain ‘fruits’, yet do not *not* attain ‘fruits’; are neither common nor free from common things [*dharmas*]; are neither sagely nor not sagely; are accomplished in all Dharma yet free from the characteristic of Dharma - then you can accept this food.”

“If, Subhūti, without seeing the Buddha, nor hearing the Dharma, taking those six teachers of heterodox ways: Purāṇa Kāśyapa, Maskari Gośālīputra, Sañjaya-Vairāṭīputra, Ajita Keśa Kambalin, Kakuda-Kātyāyana, and Nirgrantha-putra; as your teachers, leaving home for them, and with those teachers defeat suffering - then you can accept this food.

If, Subhūti, you enter erroneous views and thus never reach the ‘other shore’; remain among the eight difficulties and never be without difficulty; identify with affliction and be free from all pure Dharmas; attain the samadhi of non-contention and all sentient being also attain this concentration; and those donors who support you do not name you the field of blessing; and those who make offerings to you fall into the three evil paths; and with a group of Maras you join hands and co-operate, and you and the Maras make all kinds of trouble for the world, becoming indistinguishable from Mara; bear resentment for all sentient beings, revile the Buddhas, denigrate the Dharma, refrain from entering the Sangha, forever never attaining the liberation of cessation. If you are like this - then you can accept this food.”

“World-Honored One! When I heard him say these words, I was dumbfounded. What could I think of saying? How could I reply? I put down the alms bowl, intending to leave the house, but Vimalakirti said to me, ‘Ah, Subhūti! Pick up your alms bowl and do not be afraid. Why? If the Thus Come one were to make an illusory person, and it were to reprimand you like this, would you be afraid?’

“‘No,” I replied.”

"Vimalakirti said, 'All things [dharmas] are like illusions [have the characteristic of being illusory]. You have no reason to be afraid. Why? Because all words and pronouncements too are no different than this [characteristic]. So the wise do not cling to words and hence are not afraid of them. Why? Words are apart from self­-nature — words do not really exist. And this is liberation. The characteristic of liberation is then all things [dharmas].”

"When Vimalakirti explained the Dharma like this, two hundred heavenly beings gained purified Dharma eyes. For this reason, I cannot bare to go inquire about his illness.”

[Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra](https://www.notion.so/P-r-amaitr-ya-putra-8eea149da4b04e738b46f1672a56ff0a?pvs=21)

佛告富樓那彌多羅尼子：「汝行詣維摩詰問疾。」

The Buddha said to Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra, “You should go visit Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness.”

富樓那白佛言：「世尊！我不堪任詣彼問疾。所以者何？憶念我昔於大林中，在一樹下為諸新學比丘說法。時維摩詰來謂我言：『唯，富樓那！先當入定，觀此人心，然後說法。無以穢食置於寶器，當知是比丘心之所念，無以琉璃同彼水精。汝不能知眾生根源，無得發起以小乘法。彼自無瘡，勿傷之也；欲行大道，莫示小徑；無以大海，內於牛跡；無以日光，等彼螢火。富樓那！此比丘久發大乘心，中忘此意，如何以小乘法而教導之？我觀小乘智慧微淺，猶如盲人，不能分別一切眾生根之利鈍。』時維摩詰即入三昧，令此比丘自識宿命，曾於五百佛所植眾德本，迴向阿耨多羅三藐三菩提，即時豁然，還得本心。於是諸比丘稽首禮維摩詰足。時維摩詰因為說法，於阿耨多羅三藐三菩提不復退轉。我念聲聞不觀人根，不應說法，是故不任詣彼問疾。」

Pūrṇa replied to the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! I couldn’t bare to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? I remember, in the past, I was inside a great forest, at the foot of a tree, explaining the Dharma for all the novice students. At that time, Vimalakirti approached and said to me, 'Ah, Pūrṇa! You should first enter into meditation and observe these people’s minds, then explain the Dharma. One does not put rotten food in a precious vessel. You should know the thoughts of these *bhikṣus*. One does not treat precious lapis lazuli as though it were mere glass! If you are unable to understand the basic capacities of liv­ing beings, do not encourage them with the Dharma of a Small Vehicle. Do not inflict injury on those who are without wounds! If you want them to travel the great path, do not show them a little bypath. Do not try to fit the vast ocean into the hoofprint of an ox. Do not regard the light of the sun as if it were a firefly's glimmer.’”

“‘Pūrṇa! These *bhikṣus* generated minds of the Great Vehicle long ago, but later forgot their original intentions. Why do you use the Dharma of the little Vehicle to teach and guide them? As I see it, the wisdom of the Little Vehicle is trite and shallow, like the understanding of a blind person. It is incapable of differentiating whether the capacities of living beings are keen or dull.'”

“Then, Vimalakirti entered into samadhi, revealing to the *bhikṣus* their former lives. In the past, under five hundred Buddhas, they had planted the roots of virtue and transferred it all to *anuttara-samyak-sambodhi*. Then everything was clear and they re-attained that original intent [mind, *citta*].’”

“’With that, the *bhikṣus* bowed their heads at Vimalakirti's feet. Then, Vimalakirti explained the Dharma, causing them to never again regress from *anuttara-samyak-sambodhi*. And I thought to myself that a voice-hearer should never explain the Dharma if they are unable discern people's capacities. For this reason, I cannot bare to go inquire about his illness.”

[Mahākātyāyana](https://www.notion.so/K-ty-yana-or-Mah-k-ty-yana-839abba6ea304b128e1889c05a132450?pvs=21)

佛告摩訶迦旃延：「汝行詣維摩詰問疾。」

The Buddha said to Mahākātyāyana, “You should go visit Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness.”

迦旃延白佛言：「世尊！我不堪任詣彼問疾。所以者何？憶念昔者，佛為諸比丘略說法要，我即於後，敷演其義，謂無常義、苦義、空義、無我義、寂滅義。時維摩詰來謂我言：『唯，迦旃延！無以生滅心行，說實相法。迦旃延！諸法畢竟不生不滅，是無常義；五受陰，洞達空無所起，是苦義；諸法究竟無所有，是空義；於我、無我而不二，是無我義；法本不然，今則無滅，是寂滅義。』說是法時，彼諸比丘心得解脫。故我不任詣彼問疾。」

Kātyāyana replied to the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! I couldn’t bare to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? I remember, in the past, the Buddha had given a summary explanation of the Dharma for the *bhikṣus* and later on I was elaborating on the meaning; the meaning of impermanence, the meaning of suffering, the meaning of emptiness, the meaning of selflessness, and the meaning of tranquil extinction. At that time Vimalakirti approached and said to me, ‘Ah, Kātyāyana! The true characteristic of the Dharma should be explained without thinking of arising and ceasing. Kātyāyana! All things [*dharmas*] ultimately neither arise nor cease - this is the meaning of impermanence. The Five Aggregates are thoroughly empty, nothing [there] that could emerge - this is the meaning of suffering. All things [*dharmas*] are completely without any existence - this is the meaning of emptiness. By the self with no self yet non-dual, this is the meaning of selflessness. Things [*dharmas*] have never been "so" to begin with, and hence never cease to be "so" - this is the meaning of tranquil extinction.’

“When he explained this Dharma, all those *bhikṣus* attained liberation. For this reason, I cannot bare to go inquire about his illness.”

[Aniruddha](https://www.notion.so/Aniruddha-a1f13776d6b14946bae5f7c1e5582361?pvs=21)

佛告阿那律：「汝行詣維摩詰問疾。」

The Buddha said to Aniruddha, “You should go visit Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness.”

阿那律白佛言：「世尊！我不堪任詣彼問疾。所以者何？憶念我昔於一處經行，時有梵王，名曰嚴淨，與萬梵俱，放淨光明，來詣我所，稽首作禮問我言：『幾何阿那律天眼所見？』我即答言：『仁者！吾見此釋迦牟尼佛土三千大千世界，如觀掌中菴摩勒果。』時維摩詰來謂我言：『唯，阿那律！天眼所見，為作相耶？無作相耶？假使作相，則與外道五通等；若無作相，即是無為，不應有見。』世尊！我時默然。彼諸梵聞其言，得未曾有！即為作禮而問曰：『世孰有真天眼者？』維摩詰言：『有佛、世尊，得真天眼，常在三昧，悉見諸佛國，不以二相。』於是嚴淨梵王及其眷屬五百梵天，皆發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，禮維摩詰足已，忽然不現！故我不任詣彼問疾。」

Aniruddha replied to the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! I couldn’t bare to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? I remember once, in the past, I was somewhere walking about when a Brahma king named Purely Adorned [Śubhavyūha] along with ten thousand Brahma attendants, purely illuminated, all came to me, bowed their heads reverentially and asked, ‘How much, Aniruddha, can you see with the Divine Eye?’

“I answered them saying, ‘Gentlemen! I see this Three Thousand Great Thousand world system of Śākyamuni’s buddha land like I am observing a mango in the palm of my hand.’”

“At that time Vimalakirti approached and said to me, ‘Ah, Aniruddha! That which is seen by the Divine Eye, is it by way of characteristics or not by characteristics? If it is by characteristics, then it is the same as the five powers of the heterodox paths. If it is not by way of characteristics, then it is unconditioned and should not be ‘view’-able.’

“World-Honored One! At that time, I remained silent. Those Brahmas, hearing these words, gained what they had never had before! Then they made obeisance and asked, 'In this world, who possesses the true Divine Eye?'

"Vimalakirti replied, 'Only the Buddha, the World-Honored One, attains the true Divine Eye; constantly in samadhi, seeing all Buddha lands, not by dualistic characteristics [does not see in terms of duality].’

"Thereupon the Brahma king Purely Adorned and his retinue of five hundred Brahma gods all generated *anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta.* They bowed at Vimalakirti's feet and then suddenly vanished. For this reason, I cannot bare to go inquire about his illness.”

[Upāli](https://www.notion.so/Up-li-934f279ae0ca4952bd5820673a85eec8?pvs=21)

佛告優波離：「汝行詣維摩詰問疾。」

The Buddha said to Upāli, “You should go visit Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness.”

優波離白佛言：「世尊！我不堪任詣彼問疾。所以者何？憶念昔者，有二比丘犯律行，以為恥，不敢問佛，來問我言：『唯，優波離！我等犯律，誠以為恥，不敢問佛，願解疑悔，得免斯咎！』我即為其如法解說。時維摩詰來謂我言：『唯，優波離！無重增此二比丘罪！當直除滅，勿擾其心。所以者何？彼罪性不在內、不在外、不在中間，如佛所說，心垢故眾生垢，心淨故眾生淨。心亦不在內、不在外、不在中間，如其心然，罪垢亦然，諸法亦然，不出於如。如優波離，以心相得解脫時，寧有垢不？』我言：『不也！』維摩詰言：『一切眾生心相無垢，亦復如是。唯，優波離！妄想是垢，無妄想是淨；顛倒是垢，無顛倒是淨；取我是垢，不取我是淨。優波離！一切法生滅不住，如幻如電，諸法不相待，乃至一念不住；諸法皆妄見，如夢、如炎、如水中月、如鏡中像，以妄想生。其知此者，是名奉律；其知此者，是名善解。』於是二比丘言：『上智哉！是優波離所不能及，持律之上而不能說。』我即答言：『自捨如來，未有聲聞及菩薩，能制其樂說之辯，其智慧明達，為若此也！』時二比丘疑悔即除，發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，作是願言：『令一切眾生皆得是辯。』故我不任詣彼問疾。」

Upāli replied to the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! I couldn’t bare to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? I remember, in the past, two *bhikṣus* had violated the rules of conduct and were feeling ashamed of themselves but did not dare ask the Buddha what to do. So they came to me and said, 'Ah, Upāli! We have violated the precepts and are truly ashamed, but we do not dare ask the Buddha what to do. Please free us from our doubts and remorse and tell us how we can be excused from blame.’”

"I was explaining to them how one goes about gaining liberation according to the Dharma when Vimalakirti approached and said to me, 'Ah, Upāli! Do not make the offense these two *bhikṣus* heavier than it is! You should go about wip­ing out their doubts and remorse at once and not disturb their minds further. Why? The nature of the offense is not inside, nor is it outside, nor is it somewhere in between.  As the Buddha has explained: Because the mind is defiled, sentient beings are defiled. Because the mind is pure, sentient beings are pure. The mind is also neither inside, nor outside, nor somewhere in between. Just as your mind appears, transgression and defilement also appear; all things [*dharmas*] also appear, not coming from thusness. [i.e. they *are* thus, they don’t come from something or somewhere or something.] Like when Upāli attains liberation by means of the characteristics of mind, does defilement remain?’”

“’No,’ I said.”

“Vimalakirti replied, ‘The characterstics of all sentient beings are without defilement [’stainless,’ ‘flawless,’ *vimala*] and are also like this. Ah, Upāli! Delusional thoughts are defilement. Thoughts that are not delusional are purity. Grasping at self is defilement. Not grasping at self is purity.

“Upāli! The arising and ceasing of every thing [*dharma*] does not abide (remain) - like illusions, like lightning. All things are not relative - not abiding even for a thought [moment]. All things are totally delusional - like dreams, like mirages, like the moon in water, like reflections in a mirror - and they arise from delusional thinking. One who knows this is called [an] Upholder of the Rules of Conduct. One who knows this is called Well Liberated.’”

“‘The two *bhikṣus* said, ‘Such superior wisdom! Upāli cannot match this. There could be no better explanation of upholding the precepts.’”

“I then replied saying, ‘Except for the Thus Come One, no voice-hearer or even bodhisattva has ever commanded such eloquence in their joyful explanation. How clear and penetrating his wisdom is!

“At that time the doubts and remorse of the two *bhikṣus* were wiped away and they generated *anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta*, also making the wish, ‘May all sentient beings gain eloquence like this.’ For this reason, I cannot bare to go inquire about his illness.”

[Rāhula](https://www.notion.so/R-hula-600c2b85e5a24538ab7a1ebdb9f35627?pvs=21)

佛告羅睺羅：「汝行詣維摩詰問疾。」

The Buddha said to Rāhula, “You should go visit Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness.”

羅睺羅白佛言：「世尊！我不堪任詣彼問疾。所以者何？憶念昔時，毘耶離諸長者子來詣我所，稽首作禮，問我言：『唯，羅睺羅！汝佛之子，捨轉輪王位，出家為道。其出家者，有何等利？』我即如法為說出家功德之利。時維摩詰來謂我言：『唯，羅睺羅！不應說出家功德之利。所以者何？無利無功德，是為出家；有為法者，可說有利有功德。夫出家者，為無為法，無為法中，無利無功德。羅睺羅！出家者，無彼無此，亦無中間；離六十二見，處於涅槃；智者所受，聖所行處；降伏眾魔，度五道，淨五眼，得五力，立五根；不惱於彼，離眾雜惡；摧諸外道，超越假名；出淤泥，無繫著；無我所，無所受；無擾亂，內懷喜；護彼意，隨禪定，離眾過。若能如是，是真出家。』於是維摩詰語諸長者子：『汝等於正法中，宜共出家。所以者何？佛世難值！』諸長者子言：『居士！我聞佛言，父母不聽，不得出家。』維摩詰言：『然！汝等便發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，是即出家，是即具足。』爾時三十二長者子皆發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，故我不任詣彼問疾。」

Rāhula replied to the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! I couldn’t bare to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? I remember, in the past, all the sons of the elders of Vaiśālī came to me, bowed their heads in reverence and asked, “Ah, Rāhula! You are the Buddha's son, but you relinquished your position as wheel-turning king [*cakravartī*] and left the household life to follow the Way. What are the benefits of this?’ [i.e. ‘what are the fruits of the homeless life?’ *sāmaññaphala*].”

“I then explained the benefit of the merit of leaving the household life according to the Dharma [teachings of the Buddha]. At that time Vimalakirti approached and said to me, ‘Ah, Rāhula! You should not explain the benefits of the merit of leaving the household life. Why? Being without benefit, without merit - this is leaving the household life. The benefit and merit of conditioned things (*saṃskṛta dharma*) may be explained. The leaving of household life is something unconditioned (*asaṃskṛta dharma*), and within the unconditioned there is no benefit or merit.’”

“’Rāhula! Leaving household life is without ‘that’ and ‘this’, and also without any in between. Free from the sixty-two [erroneous] views, it abides in Nirvana. This is what the wise ‘accept’ [alluding to precepts], this is the place of practice of the sages - taming [controlling, disciplining, subjugating] the Maras, transcending the Five Ways, purifying the Five Eyes, attaining the Five Powers, and establishing the Five Faculties. Not being distressed by ‘that’, free from the mass of evils; toppling all heterodox ways, and surpassing all conventional names. Leaving the muck and mire, without any attachments; without self and without possession; without disturbance, carrying joy within; thoughts guarded, in accord with dhyana meditation - free from all transgression. If one can be like this - this is truly leaving home.’”

“Vimalakirti then said to all the sons of the elders, “You would do well to leave home together in the correct Dharma. Why? It is rare to encounter a Buddha in the world!

“The sons of the elders said, ‘Sir! We have heard the Buddha say that one must not leave the household life without the permission of one's parents.'”

Vimalakirti said, “So it is! So you should immediately generate *anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta*, and this is leaving home, this is sufficient.’”

At that moment, thirty-two sons of elders generated *anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta* and, for this reason, I cannot bare to go inquire about his illness.”



[Ānanda](https://www.notion.so/nanda-2063acf325504b62ba42532542be10d4?pvs=21)

佛告阿難：「汝行詣維摩詰問疾。」

The Buddha said to Ānanda, “You should go visit Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness.”

阿難白佛言：「世尊！我不堪任詣彼問疾。所以者何？憶念昔時，世尊身小有疾，當用牛乳，我即持鉢，詣大婆羅門家門下立。時維摩詰來謂我言：『唯，阿難！何為晨朝，持鉢住此？』我言：『居士！世尊身小有疾，當用牛乳，故來至此。』維摩詰言：『止，止！阿難！莫作是語！如來身者，金剛之體，諸惡已斷，眾善普會，當有何疾？當有何惱？默往，阿難！勿謗如來，莫使異人聞此麁言；無令大威德諸天，及他方淨土諸來菩薩得聞斯語。阿難！轉輪聖王，以少福故，尚得無病，豈況如來無量福會普勝者哉！行矣，阿難！勿使我等受斯恥也。外道、梵志，若聞此語，當作是念：「何名為師？自疾不能救，而能救諸疾？」仁可密速去，勿使人聞。當知，阿難！諸如來身，即是法身，非思欲身。佛為世尊，過於三界；佛身無漏，諸漏已盡；佛身無為，不墮諸數。如此之身，當有何疾？當有何惱？』時我，世尊！實懷慚愧，得無近佛而謬聽耶！即聞空中聲曰：『阿難！如居士言。但為佛出五濁惡世，現行斯法，度脫眾生。行矣，阿難！取乳勿慚。』世尊！維摩詰智慧辯才，為若此也。是故不任詣彼問疾。」

Ānanda replied to the Buddha saying, ““World-Honored One! I couldn’t bare to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? I remember, in the past, the World-Honored One had a little illness and could use some cow's milk. I took my begging bowl, went to the home of one of the great Brahmans, and stood by the gate. At that time Vimalakirti approached and said to me, 'Ah, Ānanda! What are you doing standing here so early in the morning with your begging bowl?'”

“I replied, ‘Sir! The World-Honored One has a little illness and could use some cow's milk, that is why I came here.’”

“Vimalakirti said, ‘Stop, stop! Ānanda! Do not say this. The body of the Thus Come One has the essence of *vajra,* cutting off all evil; a host of universal virtue gathered, how could there be illness?” How could there be affliction?’”

“’Go in silence, Ānanda! Don’t slander the Thus Come One or let others hear this coarse speech. Don't let these heavenly beings of great majesty and virtue and these bodhisattvas who have come from pure lands of other regions hear such things said.’”

 “’Ānanda! Even a wheel-turning sage king, with his few bless­ings, is still able to avoid illness. How much more so, then, the Thus Come One, in whom immeasurable blessings meet, the surpasser of all!’”

‘”Be silent, Ānanda! Don’t make us experience this shame. If brahmans of the heterodox ways hear this, they will think, ‘Why is he called a teacher? He, himself, is ill and is unable to heal, how could he heal all illness?’ Venerable, could you secretly leave at once, and do not ley anyone hear.’”

“’You should know, Ānanda! The body of all Thus Come Ones is the Dharma Body, not a sensible body of desire. The Buddha as the World Honored One transcends the Triple Realm. The body of the Buddha is without ‘outflows’ [*āsrava*], all ouflows being already having been extinguished. The body of the Buddha is unconditioned, not fitting into any category. A body like this, how could there be illness? How could there be affliction?’”

“At that time, World-Honored One! I was truly ashamed and regretful that I may have mistakenly heard what the Buddha said, even though I was so close! Then I heard a voice from nowhere [emptiness, or ‘the sky’] say, ‘Ānanda! It is as the scholar [sir] has said. But the Buddha has appeared in this evil world of five impurities and at present is cultivating the Dharma so as to save and liberate sentient beings. Be silent, Ānanda! Get the milk and do not feel ashamed!'”

"World-Honored One! Vimalakirti commands such wisdom and eloquence as this, for this reason, I cannot bare to go inquire about his illness.”

如是五百大弟子各各向佛說其本緣，稱述維摩詰所言，皆曰：「不任詣彼問疾！」

Thus all five hundred of the chief disciples one by one described to the Buddha some earlier experience and the words that Vimalakirti had spoken on that occasion, each declaring, "I cannot bare to go inquire about his illness."
## CHAPTER FOUR - *THE BODHISATTVAS*

菩薩品第四
Chapter Four - The Bodhisattvas

### Maitreya - ‘The Friendly One’ Bodhisattva

於是佛告彌勒菩薩：「汝行詣維摩詰問疾。」

Thereupon, the Buddha said to Maitreya Bodhisattva, “You You should go visit Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness.”

彌勒白佛言：「世尊！我不堪任詣彼問疾。所以者何？憶念我昔為兜率天王及其眷屬，說不退轉地之行。時維摩詰來謂我言：『彌勒！世尊授仁者記，一生當得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。為用何生，得受記乎？過去耶？未來耶？現在耶？若過去生，過去生已滅；若未來生，未來生未至；若現在生，現在生無住。如佛所說：「比丘！汝今即時，亦生亦老亦滅。」若以無生得受記者，無生即是正位，於正位中，亦無受記，亦無得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提，云何彌勒受一生記乎？為從如生得受記耶？為從如滅得受記耶？若以如生得受記者，如無有生；若以如滅得受記者，如無有滅。一切眾生皆如也，一切法亦如也，眾聖賢亦如也，至於彌勒亦如也。若彌勒得受記者，一切眾生亦應受記。所以者何？夫如者不二不異，若彌勒得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提者，一切眾生皆亦應得。所以者何？一切眾生即菩提相。若彌勒得滅度者，一切眾生亦應滅度。所以者何？諸佛知一切眾生畢竟寂滅，即涅槃相，不復更滅。是故，彌勒！無以此法誘諸天子，實無發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心者，亦無退者。彌勒！當令此諸天子，捨於分別菩提之見。所以者何？菩提者不可以身得，不可以心得；寂滅是菩提，滅諸相故；不觀是菩提，離諸緣故；不行是菩提，無憶念故；斷是菩提，捨諸見故；離是菩提，離諸妄想故；障是菩提，障諸願故；不入是菩提，無貪著故；順是菩提，順於如故；住是菩提，住法性故；至是菩提，至實際故；不二是菩提，離意法故；等是菩提，等虛空故；無為是菩提，無生住滅故；知是菩提，了眾生心行故；不會是菩提，諸入不會故；不合是菩提，離煩惱習故；無處是菩提，無形色故；假名是菩提，名字空故。如化是菩提，無取捨故；無亂是菩提，常自靜故；善寂是菩提，性清淨故；無取是菩提，離攀緣故；無異是菩提，諸法等故；無比是菩提，無可喻故；微妙是菩提，諸法難知故。』世尊！維摩詰說是法時，二百天子得無生法忍。故我不任詣彼問疾。」

Maitreya replied to the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! I couldn’t bare to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? I remember once, in the past, I was explaining practices related to the stage [*bhumi*] of nonregression to the King of the Tushita Heaven and his retinue. At that time Vimalakirti approached and said to me, 'Maitreya! The World-Honored One bestowed upon you, Venerable], the prophecy - one more birth and you will attain ***anuttara-samyak-sambodhi***. Which birth received this prophecy? Was it the past? The future? The present? If it was a past life [’birth’], that past life is extinguished; if it was in a future life, that future life has yet to arrive; if it was this present life, the present life does not remain [abide]. As the Buddha has said, “*Bhikṣus*! You are now, in this present moment, born, get old, and are extinguished.’”

“’If it was by way of birthlessness that you attained this prophecy, birthlessness is the correct status, and within the correct status there is no receiving prophecies and there is no attainment of ***anuttara-samyak-sambodhi**,* and what ‘Maitreya’ could receive a prophecy about one more birth?’”

“’Was it from the arising [birth] of Suchness [*tathatā*] that you attained reception of this prophecy? Was it from the cessation of Suchness that you attain reception of this prophecy? If it was from the arising of Suchness, Suchness is without arising. If it was from the cessation of Suchness, Suchness is without any cessation. All sentient beings are entirely such, all dharmas are also such, the gathered sages and wise ones are such, even Maitreya is such. If Maitreya received this prophecy, all sentient beings should then also receive it. Why? Suchness is nondual and undifferentiated. If Maitreya attains ***anuttara-samyak-sambodhi**,* then all sentient beings should attain it. Why? All sentient beings are characteristics of *bodhi* [awakening]. If Maitreya attains cessation [*nirodha*], then all sentient beings should attain cessation. Why? All buddhas know each sentient being is ultimately extinguished [ceased], which is the characteristic of *nirvāṇa*, and cannot again be further extinguished. For this reason, Maitreya! Inspire all these gods without using this teaching [*dharma*], for really there is no generating ***anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta***, and no one not regressing.’”

“’Maitreya! You should have these gods relinquish a discriminatory view of *bodhi* [awakening]. Why? *Bodhi* cannot be attained by the body, and it cannot be attained by the mind. Ultimate extinguishment is *bodhi* since all characteristics are extinguished. Not observing is *bodhi*, since it is beyond all conditions. Not practicing is *bodhi*, since it is without conceptualization. Severance [cutting off, detachment] is *bodhi*, since all views are relinquished. Departure [leaving, transcendence, being free from] is *bodhi*, since it is free from [transcends] all erroneous thinking. Hindrances are *bodhi*, since all vows are hindered. Not entering is *bodhi*, since it is without desirous attachments. Being in accord is *bodhi* for being in accord with Suchness. Abiding is *bodhi* due to the abiding nature of all things [*dharmas*]. Arrival is *bodhi* for it arrives at the Limit of Reality. Non-duality is *bodhi*, being free from mind and thoughts [*dharmas*]. Equanimity is *bodhi*, being equal to empty space. The unconditioned is *bodhi* because there is no arising, abiding, or ceasing. Knowledge is *bodhi* because of the practice of understanding the minds of all sentient beings. Non-Association is *bodhi* because no association is entered. Not joining is *bodhi* because it is free of all afflictions. Non-locatedness is *bodhi* because it has no shape or form. Conventional names are *bodhi* because of the emptiness of names and letters. The illusory is *bodhi* because there is nothing to grasp or relinquish. The uninverted is *bodhi* because it is always self-composed. Virtuous serenity is *bodhi* because of the purity of nature. Non-grasping is *bodhi* for being free of objectified conditionality. Nondifferentiation is *bodhi* because of the equanimous nature of all things [*dharmas*]. Without ‘this’ is *bodhi* for being incomparable [incapable of simile]. Subtle is *bodhi* due to the difficultly of understanding all phenomena [*dharmas*].’”

“World-Honored One! When Vimalakirti explained this Dharma, two hundred heavenly beings achieved the patient tolerance of the birthlessness of all things [*dharmas*]. For this reason, I cannot bare to go inquire about his illness.”     **         **

### Prabhavyūha Dārikā (A child called ‘Light Array’)

佛告光嚴童子：「汝行詣維摩詰問疾。」

The Buddha said to Prabhavyūha Dārikā, “You should go visit Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness.”

光嚴白佛言：「世尊！我不堪任詣彼問疾。所以者何？憶念我昔出毘耶離大城，時維摩詰方入城，我即為作禮而問言：『居士從何所來？』答我言：『吾從道場來。』我問：『道場者何所是？』答曰：『直心是道場，無虛假故；發行是道場，能辦事故；深心是道場，增益功德故；菩提心是道場，無錯謬故；布施是道場，不望報故；持戒是道場，得願具故；忍辱是道場，於諸眾生心無礙故；精進是道場，不懈退故；禪定是道場，心調柔故；智慧是道場，現見諸法故；慈是道場，等眾生故；悲是道場，忍疲苦故；喜是道場，悅樂法故；捨是道場，憎愛斷故；神通是道場，成就六通故；解脫是道場，能背捨故；方便是道場，教化眾生故；四攝是道場，攝眾生故；多聞是道場，如聞行故；伏心是道場，正觀諸法故；三十七品是道場，捨有為法故；諦是道場，不誑世間故；緣起是道場，無明乃至老死皆無盡故；諸煩惱是道場，知如實故；眾生是道場，知無我故；一切法是道場，知諸法空故；降魔是道場，不傾動故；三界是道場，無所趣故；師子吼是道場，無所畏故；力、無畏、不共法是道場，無諸過故；三明是道場，無餘礙故；一念知一切法是道場，成就一切智故。如是，善男子！菩薩若應諸波羅蜜教化眾生，諸有所作，舉足下足，當知皆從道場來，住於佛法矣！』說是法時，五百天、人皆發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心。故我不任詣彼問疾。」

Prabhavyūha replied to the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! I couldn’t bare to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? I remember once, in the past, I was leaving the great city of Vaiśālī. At that time, Vimalakirti was entering the city. I bowed reverentially to him and said, 'Sir, where are you coming from?'

He replied to me saying, ‘I am coming from the Site of Enlightenment [*Bodhimaṇḍala*, circle, or place of awakening; where Buddha attained enlightenment. Japanese *Dojo* - ‘Area of the Way’].’

I replied, ‘What is the Site of Enlightenment?’

He replied, ‘An upright mind is the Site of Enlightenment, for it is without being ‘baseless’ [unfounded] or false. Generating practice is the Site of Enlightenment, for it can attend to things. A profound [’deep’] mind is the Site of Enlightenment, for it increases benefits. The awakened mind [*Bodhicitta*] is the Site of Enlightenment, for it is without error or exaggeration. Generosity [*dana*], is the Site of Enlightenment, because it seeks no reward. Upholding the precepts [*sila*] is the Site of Enlightenment, because it fulfills vows. Patience tolerance [*ksanti*] is the Site of Enlightenment, because it enables one to view all sentient beings with a mind free of obstruction. Determination [*vīrya*] is the Site of Enlightenment, because it forestalls laziness and regression. Meditation [*dhyāna*] is the Site of Enlightenment, because it makes the mind tame and gentle. Wisdom [*prajñā*] is the Site of Enlightenment, because it sees all things as they are. Loving-kindness [*maitrī*] is the Site of Enlightenment, for it views all living beings equally. Compassion [*karuṇā*] is the Site of Enlightenment, for it bears up under weariness and pain. Joy [*muditā*] is the Site of Enlightenment, for it revels in Dharma delight. Equanimity [*upekṣā*] is the Site of Enlightenment, for it rejects both hatred and desire. Transcendental powers [*ṛddhi*] are the Site of Enlightenment, because thereby one masters the six powers. Liberation [*vimokṣa*] is the Site of Enlightenment, because it knows how to renounce and set aside. Expedient means [*upāya*] are the Site of Enlightenment, because they can teach and convert living beings. The four means of unification (*saṃgraha:* generosity, kind speech, volunteerism, and cooperation) are the Site of Enlightenment, because they can unify living beings. Much learning [*bāhuśrutya*] is the Site of Enlightenment, because one carries out what one has learned. A disciplined mind [*nāśayet-citta*?] is the Site of Enlightenment, because one can thereby contemplate all phenomena correctly. The thirty-seven aids to the Way [*saptatriṃśad bodhi-pākṣika-dharmāḥ*] are the Site of Enlightenment, because through them one rejects what is conditioned. Truth [*satya*] is the Site of Enlightenment, because it does not deceive the world. Conditionality [*pratītya-samutpāda*] is the Site of Enlightenment, for none of the [12] links in the chain of causation, from ignorance to old age and death, ever come to an end. Earthly desires [*sarva-kleśa*] are the Site of Enlightenment, for through them we know the nature of Suchness. ****Living beings [*sattva*] are the Site of Enlightenment, for through them we know that there is no self. All phenomena [*sarva-dharma*] are the Site of Enlightenment, for through them we know the emptiness of all phenomena. Conquering Mara [*māra-dhvaṃsana*] is the Site of Enlightenment, because one is unswayed, unflinching. The threefold world [*tridhatu*] is the Site of Enlightenment, because there is no path for one there. The lion's roar [*siṃha-nāda*] is the Site of Enlightenment, because it has nothing it fears. The ten powers, the four kinds of fearlessness, the eighteen unshared properties are the Site of Enlightenment, because they are free of all fault. The three insights [*trividyā*] are the Site of Enlightnment, because they are without the least obstruction. Understanding all dharmas in a single instant of thought is the Site of Enlightenment, because one thereby becomes master of all wisdom. Thus, good sir, if bodhisattvas apply themselves to the *pāramitās* and teach and convert living beings, then you should understand that everything they do, every lifting of a foot, every placing of a foot, will in effect be ‘coming from the Site of Enlightenment," abiding in Buddha Dharma.’”

“When this Dharma was explained, five hundred heavenly and human beings generated ***anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta***. For this reason, I cannot bare to go inquire about his illness.”

### Jagatimdhara Bodhisattva (‘Upholding the Age’)

佛告持世菩薩：「汝行詣維摩詰問疾。」

The Buddha said to Jagatimdhara Bodhisattva , “You should go visit Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness.”

持世白佛言：「世尊！我不堪任詣彼問疾。所以者何？憶念我昔，住於靜室，時魔波旬，從萬二千天女，狀如帝釋，鼓樂絃歌，來詣我所。與其眷屬，稽首我足，合掌恭敬，於一面立。我意謂是帝釋，而語之言：『善來憍尸迦！雖福應有，不當自恣。當觀五欲無常，以求善本，於身命財而修堅法。』即語我言：『正士！受是萬二千天女，可備掃灑。』我言：『憍尸迦！無以此非法之物要我沙門釋子，此非我宜。』所言未訖，時維摩詰來謂我言：『非帝釋也，是為魔來嬈固汝耳！』即語魔言：『是諸女等，可以與我，如我應受。』魔即驚懼，念：『維摩詰將無惱我？』欲隱形去，而不能隱；盡其神力，亦不得去。即聞空中聲曰：『波旬！以女與之，乃可得去。』魔以畏故，俛仰而與。

Jagatimdhara replied to the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! I couldn’t bare to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? I remember once, in the past, I was in a peaceful place, when Māra-pāpīyān (’the evil one’) along with twelve-thousand goddesses, looking like Indra with his drums, music, and song, came to where I was. Accompanied by his retinue, they bowed their heads at my feet, pressed their palms together, and stood to one side. I thought *it was* Indra, and I said to him, 'Welcome, Kaushika! Though you enjoy good fortune, you should never be self-indulgent. You should contemplate the impermanence of the five senses and strive thereby to plant good roots. With body, life, and resources you should cultivate the steadfast Dharma.’”

“But then Indra said to me, 'Noble sir, please accept these twelve thousand goddesses. They can serve and wash you.'”

"I replied, 'Kaushika! This would not be the Dharma for a *śramaņa* (ascetic), a child of Shakyamuni. It would not be right for me to accept them.'”

"Before I had finished speaking, Vimalakirti approached and said to me, 'This is not Indra. This is only Marā, who has come to trouble and vex you.' Then he said to the Marā, 'You may give these women to me. It is quite all right for me to accept them.'”

"Marā was alarmed and fearful, thinking that Vimalakirti was perhaps going to make trouble for him. He tried to hide himself and escape, but he could not make himself invisible. Though he exhausted all his supernatural powers, he could not get away.”

"Just then a voice was heard in the sky saying, 'Pāpīyān, give him the women. Then you can escape.'

"Marā, terrified, looked this way and that, and then handed over the women.”

「爾時維摩詰語諸女言：『魔以汝等與我，今汝皆當發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心。』即隨所應而為說法，令發道意。復言：『汝等已發道意，有法樂可以自娛，不應復樂五欲樂也。』天女即問：『何謂法樂？』答言：『樂常信佛，樂欲聽法，樂供養眾，樂離五欲；樂觀五陰如怨賊，樂觀四大如毒蛇，樂觀內入如空聚；樂隨護道意，樂饒益眾生，樂敬養師；樂廣行施，樂堅持戒，樂忍辱柔和，樂勤集善根，樂禪定不亂，樂離垢明慧；樂廣菩提心，樂降伏眾魔，樂斷諸煩惱，樂淨佛國土，樂成就相好故，修諸功德；樂嚴道場；樂聞深法不畏；樂三脫門，不樂非時；樂近同學，樂於非同學中，心無恚礙；樂將護惡知識，樂親近善知識；樂心喜清淨，樂修無量道品之法。是為菩薩法樂。』

“At that time, Vimalakirti addressed the women, saying, 'Marā has left you with me. Now you can generate ***anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta***.’ Then, adopting whatever approach was appropriate, he expounded the Dharma to them, awakening in them a Mind of the Way. He further said, 'Now that you have generated a Mind of the Way, you may regale yourselves with Dharma joy and need no longer delight in the pleasures of the five senses.’”

“The goddesses replied, ‘What is this you call Dharma joy?'”

"Vimalakirti replied, 'To delight in constant faith in the Buddha, to delight in the desire to hear the Dharma, to delight in giving alms to the sangha, to delight in casting off the five senses, to delight in observing the five aggregates as vengeful bandits, to delight in observing the four great elements as poiso­nous snakes, to delight in observing the mind and the senses as an empty village, to delight in following and guarding a Mind of the Way, to delight in benefiting living beings, to delight in hon­oring and supporting teachers, to delight in practicing wide spread generosity, to delight in the observance of the precepts, to delight in patience, humility, gentleness, and harmony, to delight in diligently amassing good roots, to delight in medita­tion that is never disordered, to delight in bright, undefiled wis­dom, to delight in broadening the mind that aspires to *bodhi*, to delight in conquering and subduing Marā, to delight in cutting off all afflictions, to delight in purifying Buddha lands, to delight in gaining merit so that one may in time succeed in acquiring auspicious characteristics, to delight in adorning the ‘site of enlightenment’, to delight in listening fearlessly to profound Dharma, to delight in the three gates to liberation and *not* to delight in untimely teachings, to delight in being friendly with those of like learning, to delight in a mind free of anger and hostility when among those of unlike learn­ing, to delight in guiding and protecting friends that you know who are evil, to delight in being friendly with good friends, to delight in a mind that finds joy in purity, to delight in practicing the Dharma regard­ing the immeasurable elements of the Way — these make up the Dharma joy of a bodhisattva.'”

「於是波旬告諸女言：『我欲與汝俱還天宮。』諸女言：『以我等與此居士，有法樂，我等甚樂，不復樂五欲樂也。』魔言：『居士可捨此女？一切所有施於彼者，是為菩薩。』維摩詰言：『我已捨矣！汝便將去，令一切眾生得法願具足。』於是諸女問維摩詰：『我等云何，止於魔宮？』維摩詰言：『諸姊！有法門名無盡燈，汝等當學。無盡燈者，譬如一燈，燃百千燈，冥者皆明，明終不盡。如是，諸姊！夫一菩薩開導百千眾生，令發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，於其道意亦不滅盡，隨所說法，而自增益一切善法，是名無盡燈也。汝等雖住魔宮，以是無盡燈，令無數天子天女，發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心者，為報佛恩，亦大饒益一切眾生。』爾時天女頭面禮維摩詰足，隨魔還宮，忽然不現。世尊！維摩詰有如是自在神力，智慧辯才，故我不任詣彼問疾。」

"Papiyan then addressed the women, saying, 'I want to return with you to my heavenly palace.’ But the women said, 'You gave us to this layman. Possessing this Dharma joy, we are extremely joyful, we no longer delight in the plea­sures of the five senses.'”

“Marā said, ‘Layman, are you able to relinquish these women? The one who gives away everything they have, this is a bodhisattva.’”

“Vimalakirti replied, ‘I have already relinquished them! You can leave, but you must fulfill all sentient beings wish for the Dharma.’”

“At this, all the women asked Vimalakirti, ‘How can we stay in Marā’s palace?’”

“Vimalakirti replied, ‘Sisters! There is a Dharma Door called the Inexhaustible Lamp, which you should study. The inexhaustible lamp is like one lamp that ignites a hundred thousand lamps, illuminating all darkness with an illumination that is never exhausted. Like this, sisters! One bodhisattva opens and guides a hundred thousand sentient beings, causing them to generate ***anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta***, the mind set on the Way will also never be extinguished or exhausted, and by following the Dharma as it has been explained, one increases their offering of all virtuous Dharmas - this is called the Inexhaustible Lamp. Although you reside in Marā’s palace, with this Inexhaustible Lamp you can enable countless gods and goddesses to generate ***anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta***. Thus you will repay the Buddha’s kindness and also greatly benefit sentient beings.’”

"At that time the goddesses bowed their heads at Vimalakirti's feet and then accompanied Marā back to his palace, suddenly disappearing from sight. World-Honored One! Vimalakirti possesses such sovereign command of supernatural powers like this, knowledge, wisdom and eloquence, and for this reason, I cannot bare to go inquire about his illness.”

### Sudatta - the Elder’s Son

佛告長者子善德：「汝行詣維摩詰問疾。」

The Buddha said to the elder’s son, Sudatta, “You should go visit Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness.”

善德白佛言：「世尊！我不堪任詣彼問疾。所以者何？憶念我昔自於父舍設大施會，供養一切沙門、婆羅門，及諸外道、貧窮、下賤、孤獨、乞人。期滿七日，時維摩詰來入會中，謂我言：『長者子！夫大施會不當如汝所設，當為法施之會，何用是財施會為？』我言：『居士！何謂法施之會？』答曰：『法施會者，無前無後，一時供養一切眾生，是名法施之會。』曰：『何謂也？』『謂以菩提，起於慈心；以救眾生，起大悲心；以持正法，起於喜心；以攝智慧，行於捨心；以攝慳貪，起檀波羅蜜；以化犯戒，起尸羅波羅蜜；以無我法，起羼提波羅蜜；以離身心相，起毘梨耶波羅蜜；以菩提相，起禪波羅蜜；以一切智，起般若波羅蜜。教化眾生，而起於空；不捨有為法，而起無相；示現受生，而起無作；護持正法，起方便力；以度眾生，起四攝法；以敬事一切，起除慢法；於身命財，起三堅法；於六念中，起思念法；於六和敬，起質直心；正行善法，起於淨命；心淨歡喜，起近賢聖；不憎惡人，起調伏心；以出家法，起於深心；以如說行，起於多聞；以無諍法，起空閑處；趣向佛慧，起於宴坐；解眾生縛，起修行地；以具相好，及淨佛土，起福德業；知一切眾生心念，如應說法，起於智業；知一切法，不取不捨，入一相門，起於慧業；斷一切煩惱、一切障礙、一切不善法，起一切善業；以得一切智慧、一切善法，起於一切助佛道法。如是，善男子！是為法施之會。若菩薩住是法施會者，為大施主，亦為一切世間福田。』

Sudatta replied to the Buddha saying, “World-honored One! I couldn’t bare to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? I remember once, in the past, I was holding a great ‘giving gathering’ in my father’s house. We made offerings to all the śramaṇas, brahmans, those of the heterodox paths, the poor, low-class, orphans, and beggars. After a full seven days, Vimalakīrti entered the gathering and said to me, ‘Elder’s son! You should not hold a great giving gathering like this. You should have a gathering for giving the Dharma. What use is a gathering to give material wealth?’”

“I said, ‘Sir! What does a gathering for giving Dharma mean?’”

“He answered, ‘A gathering for giving Dharma has no before or after. In a single thought-moment, offerings are made to all sentient beings. This is called gathering for giving Dharma.’”

“I replied, ‘What does that mean?’”

“He said, ‘It means: by way of *bodhi* (awakening) one gives rise to a mind of loving-kindness, by aiding living beings one gives rise to a mind of great compassion, by adhering to the correct Dharma one cultivates a joyful mind, and by embracing wisdom one practices with an equanimous mind. By embracing grudging and greed one gives rise to *dāna-pāramitā*. By ‘converting’ (transforming) those who break the rules one gives rise to *śīla-pāramitā.* By way of the Dharma of ‘no-self’ one gives rise to *kṣānti-pāramitā.* By transcending the characteristics of body and mind one gives rise to *vīrya-pāramitā.* By the characteristic of *bodhi* (awakening) one gives rise to *dhyāna-pāramitā.* And by omniscience one gives rise to *prajñā-pāramitā*.’”

‘”[It means:] Teaching and transforming sentient beings, yet giving rise to emptiness. Not relinquishing conditioned dharmas, yet giving rise to characteristiclessness. Having the appearance of taking birth, yet giving rise to wishlessness.’”

“’Guarding the correct Dharma, one gives rise to the power of expedient means. By rescuing sentient beings one gives rise to the Four Means of Unification. By revering everything, one gives rise to the elimination of conceit. Through body, life, and wealth [the ‘three unstable thing’] one gives rise to the three stable things. Being within the six mindfulnesses one gives rise to contemplation of the dharma. Through the six types of considerate esteem (*saṃrañjanīyadharma*: *metta* in body, speech, and mind, sharing, morality, and correct view) one generates sincerity. Correctly practicing the subtle dharma, one gives rise to pure livelihood. With a mind pure and joyful, one ‘rises’ nearer to the wise and sagely. Not having aversion for bad people, one generates a disciplined mind. By the dharma of leaving home, one gives rise to a profound mind. ******By practicing according to the explanation, one generates erudition. By the dharma of non-contention, one gives rise to the place of solitary practice [*araṇya*]. Approaching the Wisdom of the Buddha, one gives rise to a meditative posture. Releasing the bonds of sentient beings, one gives rise to the cultivation of the stages. By being gloriously adorned with auspicious characteristics and purifying a buddha land, one gives rise to meritorious karma. Understanding the thoughts of all sentient beings and how one should explain the Dharma to them, one gives rise to the karma of knowledge. Understanding all the dharmas, neither grasping nor relinquishing, entering the gateway of the Single Characteristic, one gives rise to the karma of wisdom. Cutting off all the afflictions, all the hindrances, and all the unvirtuous dharmas, one gives rise to all virtuous karma. By attaining all-knowing wisdom, all virtuous dharmas, one gives rise to all the dharmas that assist one’s Way to Buddhahood [i.e. ’the 37 aids to awakening’].’

“’Thus, virtuous man! *This* is a gathering for giving Dharma. If a bodhisattva abides in this gathering for giving Dharma they will be a great donor and a field of blessings for the entire world.’”

世尊！維摩詰說是法時，婆羅門眾中二百人，皆發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心。我時心得清淨，歎未曾有！稽首禮維摩詰足，即解瓔珞價直百千以上之，不肯取。我言：『居士！願必納受，隨意所與。』維摩詰乃受瓔珞，分作二分，持一分施此會中一最下乞人，持一分奉彼難勝如來。一切眾會皆見光明國土難勝如來，又見珠瓔在彼佛上變成四柱寶臺，四面嚴飾，不相障蔽。時維摩詰現神變已，作是言：『若施主等心施一最下乞人，猶如如來福田之相，無所分別，等于大悲，不求果報，是則名曰具足法施。』城中一最下乞人，見是神力，聞其所說，皆發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，故我不任詣彼問疾。」

“World-honored One! When Vimalakīrti explained this Dharma, two hundred people among the assembly of brahmans all generated ***anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi citta***. At that moment, my own mind attained a level of purity I had never had. I bowed my head to Vimalakīrti’s feet in reverence and unfastened my necklace (*mālā*), a hundred thousand in value, to give to him, but he would not accept it. I said, ‘Please, sir, you must accept this and give it to whomever you please.’”

“Vimalakīrti then accepted the necklace and divided it into two parts. Taking one part, he gave it to the lowliest beggars in the assembly. Taking the other part, he offered it to Sudurjayā Tathāgata (’Difficult to Conquer’ Thus Come One). The entire assembly then saw the land Radiant Illumination and the Tathāgata Sudurjayā . They also saw a pearl necklace on that Buddha change into a four tier jewel-laden platform, with ornamentation of mutually noninterfering characteristics on all four sides.”

“Having manifested these spiritual transformations, Vimalakīrti then said, ‘If a donor gives to the lowliest of beggars with an equanimous mind [heart], just as if they were giving to the Tathāgata’s field of blessings, with no distinction, with great compassion without seeking any reward, this is called “being completed (accomplished) in the Dharma of Giving.”’

“The lowliest beggars in the city, seeing this spiritual power and hearing this explanation, all generated ***anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi citta.*** For this reason, I cannot bare to go inquire about his illness.”

如是諸菩薩各各向佛說其本緣，稱述維摩詰所言，皆曰：「不任詣彼問疾！」

Like this, all the bodhisattvas each explained their original encounters with Vimalakīrti to the Buddha and related what he said, each one saying they, ‘couldn’t bare to go inquire about his illness.’”
## CHAPTER FIVE - *MAÑJUŚRĪ INQUIRES ABOUT ILLNESS*

文殊師利問疾品第五
Chapter Five: Mañjuśrī Inquires About Illness

爾時佛告文殊師利：「汝行詣維摩詰問疾。」

Then the Buddha said to Mañjuśrī, “You should go visit Vimalakīrti and inquire about his illness.”

文殊師利白佛言：「世尊！彼上人者，難為詶對。深達實相，善說法要，辯才無滯，智慧無礙；一切菩薩法式悉知，諸佛祕藏無不得入；降伏眾魔，遊戲神通，其慧方便，皆已得度。雖然，當承佛聖旨，詣彼問疾。」

Mañjuśrī replied to the Buddha saying, “World Honored One! That is a superior person, difficult to approach [discourse with]. He has deeply penetrated the True Characteristic, and is good at explaining the essentials of the Dharma. With unhindered eloquence, his wisdom is unobstructed. He thoroughly understands all the dharma and style of bodhisattvas and has entered into the secret treasuries of all the buddhas without attainment. Subjugator of Māras, he plays (*vikrīḍita*) with the super powers. His *prajñā* is upayic - having totally attained liberation. **Nevertheless, I will accept the Buddha’s sagely request and proceed to inquire about his illness.”

於是眾中諸菩薩、大弟子、釋、梵、四天王等，咸作是念：「今二大士，文殊師利、維摩詰共談，必說妙法！」即時八千菩薩、五百聲聞、百千天、人皆欲隨從。

Then the bodhisattvas and major disciples in the assembly, the Brahmas, Indras, and Four Heavenly Kings, all thought to themselves: ‘Now these two great men, Mañjuśrī and Vimalakirti, will be talking together, and they will surely explain the subtle Dharma!" At that time eight thousand bodhisattvas, five hundred voice-hearers, and hundreds and thousands of heavenly and human beings all wished to follow along.

於是文殊師利與諸菩薩、大弟子眾及諸天、人，恭敬圍繞，入毘耶離大城。

Then Mañjuśrī, with all the bodhisattvas, major disciples, and human and heavenly beings reverently surrounding and accompanying him, proceeded to enter the great city of Vaishali.

爾時長者維摩詰心念：「今文殊師利與大眾俱來！」即以神力空其室內，除去所有及諸侍者；唯置一床，以疾而臥。

At that time, the elder Vimalakīrti pondered, ‘Mañjuśrī and a great company are now coming!’ Then, by spiritual power, he ‘emptied’ his house, and everything there was was gone, even the assistants. The only thing left standing was a bed upon which the ill reclined.

文殊師利既入其舍，見其室空，無諸所有，獨寢一床。時維摩詰言：「善來，文殊師利！不來相而來，不見相而見。」

When Mañjuśrī entered the house he saw that it had been emptied, without anything there, only a bed ‘resting’.

Then Vimalakīrti said, ‘Well come, Mañjuśrī! You arrive with the characteristic of not arriving; You are seen with the characteristic of not being seen.’

文殊師利言：「如是！居士！若來已，更不來；若去已，更不去。所以者何？來者無所從來，去者無所至，所可見者，更不可見。且置是事，居士！是疾寧可忍不？療治有損，不至增乎！世尊慇懃致問無量，居士是疾，何所因起？其生久如？當云何滅？」

Mañjuśrī replied, ‘So it is! Householder (*Kulapati*)! What has already arrived has no more arriving; what has departed has no more departing. How so? That which arrives has nowhere to come from, that which is gone has nowhere to go, that which can be seen, is no more seen. But enough of these things (going’s ons), *Kulapati,* this illness. Is it tolerable? Is the treatment having an effect? Say it hasn’t increased!”

維摩詰言：「從癡、有愛，則我病生。以一切眾生病，是故我病；若一切眾生病滅，則我病滅。所以者何？菩薩為眾生故入生死，有生死則有病；若眾生得離病者，則菩薩無復病。譬如長者，唯有一子，其子得病，父母亦病。若子病愈，父母亦愈。菩薩如是，於諸眾生，愛之若子；眾生病則菩薩病，眾生病愈，菩薩亦愈。又言是疾，何所因起？菩薩病者，以大悲起。」

Vimalakīrti replied, “From confusion there is love (’lust’), then my illness arises. It is because all sentient beings are ill that I am ill. If all sentient beings’ illness ceases, then my illness ceases. How is that? The bodhisattva enters birth & death (*saṃsāra*) for all sentient beings. Having birth & death [i.e. being in *saṃsāra*], then there is illness. If sentient beings attain freedom from illness, then the bodhisattva is without further illness. Just like parents, whose only child becomes ill. The father and mother are also ill. If the child’s illness feels better, the father and mother also feel better. It could also be asked of this illness, how does it come about? The bodhisattva’s illness comes about through great compassion.”

文殊師利言：「居士此室，何以空無侍者？」

Mañjuśrī said, “*Kulapati,* this room, how is it empty, without assistants?”

維摩詰言：「諸佛國土亦復皆空。」

Vimalakīrti said, “The lands of all buddha lands are also entirely empty.”

又問：「以何為空？」

Again he asked, “*What* is empty?”

答曰：「以空空。」

He replied saying, “Emptiness is empty.”

又問：「空何用空？」

Again he asked, “How can emptiness be empty?”

答曰：「以無分別空故空。」

He replied saying, “By not differentiating (*nirvikalpa*) emptiness, there is emptiness.”

又問：「空可分別耶？」

Again he asked, “Emptiness can be differentiated?

答曰：「分別亦空。」

He replied saying, “Differentiation (*parikalpa*) is also empty.”

又問：「空當於何求？」

Again he asked, “How should emptiness be sought?”

答曰：「當於六十二見中求。」

He replied saying, “It should be sought by the 62 [erroneous] views.”

又問：「六十二見當於何求？」

Again he asked, “How should the 62 views be sought?”

答曰：「當於諸佛解脫中求。」

He replied saying, “They should be sought within the liberation of all buddhas.”

又問：「諸佛解脫當於何求？」

Again he asked, “How should the liberation of all buddhas be sought?”

答曰：「當於一切眾生心行中求。又仁所問：『何無侍者？』一切眾魔及諸外道，皆吾侍也。所以者何？眾魔者樂生死，菩薩於生死而不捨；外道者樂諸見，菩薩於諸見而不動。」

He replied saying, “It should be sought within the conditioned mind of every sentient being. You, sir, also asked ‘How is it without assistants?’ Every horde of Mara and all the outside ways (’heretics’), they are all my assistants. How so? Hordes of Mara delight in birth & death (*saṃsāra*), whereas the bodhisattva does not relinquish birth & death; those of outside ways delight in views (*dṛṣṭi*), whereas the bodhisattva is not moved by views.”

文殊師利言：「居士所疾，為何等相？」

Mañjuśrī said, “The *kulapati’*s illness, what are its characteristics?”

維摩詰言：「我病無形不可見。」

Vimalakīrti replied, “My illness is without shape, it cannot be seen.”

又問：「此病身合耶？心合耶？」

Again he asked, “This illness, is it of the body or of the mind?”

答曰：「非身合，身相離故；亦非心合，心如幻故。」

He replied saying, “It is not of the body, since bodily characteristics are transcendent (departed); and it is also not of the mind, since the mind is like an illusion.”

又問：「地大、水大、火大、風大，於此四大，何大之病？」

Again he asked, “Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, of these four Great Elements, of which element is this illness?

答曰：「是病非地大，亦不離地大；水、火、風大，亦復如是。而眾生病，從四大起，以其有病，是故我病。」

He replied saying, “This illness is not of Earth, but it also is not apart from (transcendent of) Earth. Water, Fire, and Wind are also like this. However, the illnesses of sentient beings are from the four Great Elements, and because they have illness, I am ill.

爾時文殊師利問維摩詰言：「菩薩應云何慰喻有疾菩薩？」

Then, Mañjuśrī inquired of Vimalakīrti saying, “How should a bodhisattva comfort bodhisattvas who are ill?”

維摩詰言：「說身無常，不說厭離於身；說身有苦，不說樂於涅槃；說身無我，而說教導眾生；說身空寂，不說畢竟寂滅；說悔先罪，而不說入於過去；以己之疾，愍於彼疾；當識宿世無數劫苦，當念饒益一切眾生；憶所修福，念於淨命，勿生憂惱，常起精進；當作醫王，療治眾病。菩薩應如是慰喻有疾菩薩，令其歡喜。」

Vimalakīrti said, “Tell them the body is impermanent but don’t tell them to despise the body. Tell them the body is suffering but don’t tell them to take pleasure in Nirvana. Tell them the body is without self, yet tell them to teach and guide sentient beings. Tell them the body is quiescent but don’t tell them of ultimate cessation (*ātyantika-nirvāṇa*). Tell them of remorse for former transgressions, yet don’t tell them to enter [dwell in] the past. By one’s own illness, comfort the illness of others. One should be conscious of the immeasurable *kalpas* of past lifetimes of suffering. One should be mindful of benefiting all sentient beings. Remember blessings that have been cultivated. Be mindful of pure livelihood. Never give rise to vexation. Constantly bring forth determination (*virya*). One should be a Physician King, healing all the various illnesses. Bodhisattvas should comfort bodhisattvas who are ill like this, by making them happy.”      **

文殊師利言：「居士！有疾菩薩云何調伏其心？」

Mañjuśrī said, “*Kulapati*! Bodhisattvas who are ill, how can they control [tame, discipline, subdue, temper] their minds?”

維摩詰言：「有疾菩薩應作是念：『今我此病，皆從前世妄想顛倒諸煩惱生，無有實法，誰受病者！所以者何？四大合故，假名為身；四大無主，身亦無我；又此病起，皆由著我。是故於我，不應生著。』既知病本，即除我想及眾生想。當起法想，應作是念：『但以眾法，合成此身；起唯法起，滅唯法滅。又此法者，各不相知，起時不言我起，滅時不言我滅。』彼有疾菩薩為滅法想，當作是念：『此法想者，亦是顛倒，顛倒者是即大患，我應離之。』云何為離？離我、我所。云何離我、我所？謂離二法。云何離二法？謂不念內外諸法行於平等。云何平等？謂我等、涅槃等。所以者何？我及涅槃，此二皆空。以何為空？但以名字故空。如此二法，無決定性，得是平等；無有餘病，唯有空病；空病亦空。是有疾菩薩以無所受而受諸受，未具佛法，亦不滅受而取證也。

Vimalakīrti said, “Bodhisattvas who are ill should think, ‘This present illness of mine comes entirely from confused, inverted thinking from the past, born of all the afflictions. There is no actual *dharma* (‘thing’ or phenomena) that experiences illness! How is that so? Due to the coming together of the Four Great Elements, there is what is provisionally called a ‘body’. The Four Great Elements are without a master, and the body is also without a self. And so this illness arises entirely from attachment to self. For this reason, one should not give rise to attachment to self.’”

“Thereby understanding the origin of illness, they then cease perception of a self and the perception of sentient beings. One should give rise to the perception of *dharmas* and they should think, ‘It is only through the gathering of *dharmas* that this body is produced. Its arising is only the arising of *dharmas*. Its ceasing is only the cessation of *dharmas*. Also, these *dharmas*, each is unknown to the other. When they arise, they do not say, “I have arisen.” When the cease they do not say, “I cease.””

“These bodhisattvas who are ill consider the perception of the cessation of *dharmas* and they should think, ‘This perception of *dharmas*, this is also inverted thinking, and inverted thinking is a great calamity that I ought to transcend.’ How is it transcended? By transcending ‘I’ and ‘mine’. How are ‘I’ and ‘mine’ transcended? By transcending duality. How is duality transcended? By being without mindfulness of interiority or exteriority, regarding all *dharmas* with equanimity. What is equanimity? It is the equality of self and Nirvana. How is that so? The self and Nirvana, these [’this duo’] are empty. Because they are merely names, they are empty. Like this, duality [or, ‘these two *dharmas*’] is without any certain, fixed nature, and this attainment is equanimity, without any remaining illness, there being only the illness of emptiness, and the illness of emptiness is empty.”

“These bodhisattvas who are ill, by there being nothing to experience, experience all experiences, and while not yet complete in Buddha Dharma, acquire realization without the cessation of experience.”

「設身有苦，念惡趣眾生，起大悲心，我既調伏，亦當調伏一切眾生；但除其病，而不除法，為斷病本而教導之。何謂病本？謂有攀緣，從有攀緣，則為病本。何所攀緣？謂之三界。云何斷攀緣？以無所得，若無所得，則無攀緣。何謂無所得？謂離二見。何謂二見？謂內見外見，是無所得。文殊師利！是為有疾菩薩調伏其心，為斷老病死苦，是菩薩菩提。若不如是，己所修治，為無慧利。譬如勝怨，乃可為勇。如是兼除老病死者，菩薩之謂也。

“Suppose the body has suffering. Be mindful of sentient beings born in evil realms and give rise to a greatly compassionate mind, [thinking] ‘I have controlled [tamed, disciplined, subdued, tempered] the mind, I should also tame all sentient beings’, by just eliminating the illness, but not eliminating any thing (*dharma*), teaching and guiding how to cut off the root of illness. What is the root of illness? It is troublesome entanglements. The root of illness is from there being troublesome entanglements. What is that which is entangled? That which is of the Triple World. How are troublesome entanglements cut off? By there being nothing to attain. If there is nothing to attain, then there are no troublesome entanglements. Why is it said there is nothing to attain? It is beyond dualistic views. What is called a dualist view? It is the view from within and the view of outside - these are without attainment.”

“Mañjuśrī! This is how these bodhisattvas who are ill control their minds, how they cut off old age, illness, death, and suffering. This is bodhisattva *bodhi*. If it is not like this, then that which has been practiced will have been without wisdom or benefit. Just like one who is victorious over their enemy may be considered a hero. Like this, a bodhisattva is so called for being one who eliminates old-age, illness, and death.”

「彼有疾菩薩應復作是念：『如我此病，非真非有，眾生病亦非真非有。』作是觀時，於諸眾生若起愛見大悲，即應捨離。所以者何？菩薩斷除客塵煩惱而起大悲。愛見悲者，則於生死有疲厭心。若能離此，無有疲厭，在在所生，不為愛見之所覆也。所生無縛，能為眾生說法解縛，如佛所說：『若自有縛，能解彼縛，無有是處！若自無縛，能解彼縛，斯有是處。』是故菩薩不應起縛。何謂縛？何謂解？貪著禪味，是菩薩縛；以方便生，是菩薩解。又無方便慧縛，有方便慧解；無慧方便縛，有慧方便解。何謂無方便慧縛？謂菩薩以愛見心莊嚴佛土、成就眾生；於空、無相、無作法中，而自調伏，是名無方便慧縛。何謂有方便慧解？謂不以愛見心莊嚴佛土、成就眾生，於空、無相、無作法中，以自調伏，而不疲厭，是名有方便慧解。何謂無慧方便縛？謂菩薩住貪欲、瞋恚、邪見等諸煩惱，而植眾德本，是名無慧方便縛。何謂有慧方便解？謂離諸貪欲、瞋恚、邪見等諸煩惱，而植眾德本；迴向阿耨多羅三藐三菩提，是名有慧方便解。文殊師利！彼有疾菩薩，應如是觀諸法，又復觀身無常、苦、空、非我，是名為慧；雖身有疾，常在生死，饒益一切，而不厭倦，是名方便。又復觀身，身不離病，病不離身，是病是身，非新非故，是名為慧；設身有疾，而不永滅，是名方便。

“Those bodhisattvas who are ill should also think, ‘Just as my illness is neither real nor existent, the illness of sentient beings is neither real nor existent.’ When making this observation, if there should arise an affectionate view of great compassion for all sentient beings, then this too should be relinquished. Why? Bodhisattvas remove completely defiling dust and afflictions (*āgantu-kleśa*), and then give rise to great compassion. One who is compassionate from an affectionate view will then have a mind of aversion toward birth & death (*saṃsāra*). If one is able to transcend that, they will be without aversion. And wherever they ‘are (re)born’ [happen to find themselves], they wont be blinded by affectionate views. Being born without bonds, they are able to explain to sentient beings the liberation of the Dharma. As the Buddha said, ‘If one is bound themselves, there is no way they would be able to free another! If one is without bonds, there is certainly a way they would be able to free another.’ For this reason, bodhisattvas should not give rise to bonds. What are bonds? What is freedom? A desirous attachment to the taste of *dhyana* meditation, that is the bond of bodhisattvas. Being born of skillful means is the freedom of bodhisattvas.”

”Further, to be without skillful means is to have bound wisdom, while to have skillful means is to have liberated wisdom. To be without wisdom is to have bound skillful means, while to have wisdom is to have liberated skillful means. What is it to be without skillful means and to have wisdom in bondage? It is for bodhisattvas to use affection to adorn buddha lands and fulfill sentient beings, to control oneself within emptiness, characteristiclessness, and wishlessness. This is called being without skillful means and having wisdom in bondage. What is it to have skillful means with liberated wisdom? It is not to use affection to adorn buddha lands and fulfill sentient beings, and to control oneself so as to be without aversion within emptiness, characteristiclessness, and wishlessness. This is called having skillful means with liberated wisdom.”

“What is it to be without wisdom and to have bound skillful means? It is for bodhisattvas to plant a host of virtuous roots while abiding in the afflictions of desire, anger, and false views. This is called being without wisdom with skillful means in bondage. What is it to have wisdom with liberated skillful means? It is to transcend the afflictions of desire, anger, and false views and plant a host of virtuous roots, transferring (*pariṇāmanā*) it to *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. This is called having wisdom with liberated skillful means.”

“Mañjuśrī! Bodhisattvas ****who are ill should observe *dharmas* like this. Also, to observe the body as impermanent, suffering, empty, and no-self is called wisdom. Though the body is ill, it always exists in birth & death. To benefit all without tiring, this is called skillful means. Also, to observe the body, [one should realize] that the body does not transcend illness and illness does not transcend the body, and that this illness and this body are neither new nor old, this is called wisdom. For one’s body to be ill but to never cease is called skillful means.”

「文殊師利！有疾菩薩應如是調伏其心，不住其中，亦復不住不調伏心。所以者何？若住不調伏心，是愚人法；若住調伏心，是聲聞法。是故菩薩不當住於調伏、不調伏心，離此二法，是菩薩行。在於生死，不為污行；住於涅槃，不永滅度，是菩薩行；非凡夫行，非賢聖行，是菩薩行；非垢行，非淨行，是菩薩行；雖過魔行，而現降眾魔，是菩薩行；求一切智，無非時求，是菩薩行；雖觀諸法不生，而不入正位，是菩薩行；雖觀十二緣起，而入諸邪見，是菩薩行；雖攝一切眾生，而不愛著，是菩薩行；雖樂遠離，而不依身心盡，是菩薩行；雖行三界，而不壞法性，是菩薩行；雖行於空，而植眾德本，是菩薩行；雖行無相，而度眾生，是菩薩行；雖行無作，而現受身，是菩薩行；雖行無起，而起一切善行，是菩薩行；雖行六波羅蜜，而遍知眾生心、心數法，是菩薩行；雖行六通，而不盡漏，是菩薩行；雖行四無量心，而不貪著生於梵世，是菩薩行；雖行禪定解脫三昧，而不隨禪生，是菩薩行；雖行四念處，而不永離身受心法，是菩薩行；雖行四正勤，而不捨身心精進，是菩薩行；雖行四如意足，而得自在神通，是菩薩行；雖行五根，而分別眾生諸根利鈍，是菩薩行；雖行五力，而樂求佛十力，是菩薩行；雖行七覺分，而分別佛之智慧，是菩薩行；雖行八聖道，而樂行無量佛道，是菩薩行；雖行止觀助道之法，而不畢竟墮於寂滅，是菩薩行；雖行諸法不生不滅，而以相好莊嚴其身，是菩薩行；雖現聲聞、辟支佛威儀，而不捨佛法，是菩薩行；雖隨諸法究竟淨相，而隨所應為現其身，是菩薩行；雖觀諸佛國土永寂如空，而現種種清淨佛土，是菩薩行；雖得佛道轉于法輪，入於涅槃，而不捨於菩薩之道，是菩薩行。」

“Mañjuśrī! Bodhisattvas who are ill should control their minds like this, not abiding within [a controlled mind], and also not abiding without a controlled mind. How is that so? If they were to abide in [or with] an undisciplined mind, this is the method (*dharma*) of fools. If they abide with a controlled mind, this is the method of Voice Hearers. For this reason, bodhisattvas shouldn’t abide in a controlled mind or an uncontrolled mind. Transcending this duality (this duo, these two *dharmas*), this is the practice of bodhisattvas. To be within birth & death without polluting practices, to abide in Nirvana without ever completely ceasing, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Neither a common practice nor the practice of sages, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Neither defiled practice nor pure practice, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though they perform practices of Mara, they then subjugate the hordes of Mara, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Seeking omniscience, but not seeking at the wrong time, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though observing that all *dharmas* are birthless, they do not enter the absolute, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though observing the 12 links of the chain of origination arise, they enter all erroneous views, this is the practice of bodhisattvas.

 Though embracing all sentient beings, they are without affectionate attachment, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though delighting in transcendence, they do not rely on eliminating body and mind, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though practicing in the Triple Realm, they do not destroy the nature of *dharmas*, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though practicing within emptiness, they plant hosts of virtuous roots, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though practicing with characteristiclessness, they rescue sentient beings, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though practicing within wishlessness, they appear to ‘receive’ a body, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. ****Though practicing without arising, they give rise to all virtuous practices, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. ****Though practicing the six *paramitas* (transcendences), they transcend the minds and inclinations of all sentient beings, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though practicing the six penetrations, they do not cease outflows, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though practicing the four immeasurable states of mind, they do not desire being reborn in the Brahmaviharas, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though practicing *dhyāna*, *vimokṣa*, *and samādhi*, they are not reborn in accord with *dhyāna*, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though practicing the four foundations of mindfulness, they never transcend body, sensations, mind-states, and *dharmas,* this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though practicing the four right efforts, they never relinquish determination (*vīrya*) of body and mind, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. ****Though practicing the four steps towards supernatural power (*ṛddhipāda*), they have attained sovereign spiritual power, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though practicing the five faculties, they differentiate the sharp and dull faculties of all sentient beings, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though practicing the five powers, they delight in seeking the ten powers of a buddha, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though practicing the seven aids to awakening, they differentiate the wisdom of the buddhas, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though practicing the noble eightfold path, they delight in practicing the immeasurable path of the buddha, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though practicing ‘stopping’ and ‘observing’ as factors of the path, they do not sink into tranquil cessation, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though practicing the non-arising and non-ceasing of all *dharmas*, they adorn their bodies with [the] auspicious characteristics, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though appearing with the deportment of voice hearers or solitary buddhas, they do not relinquish the Buddha Dharma, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though being in accord with the ultimate characteristic of purity of all *dharmas*, they manifest bodily in accord with what is needed, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though observing that the lands of all buddha lands are forever tranquil like empty space, they appear in all kinds of pure buddha lands, this is the practice of bodhisattvas. Though attaining the Buddha Way [i.e. ‘enlightenment’], turning the Dharma Wheel, and entering Nirvana, they never relinquish the Way of the Bodhisattva, this is the practice of bodhisattvas.”

說是語時，文殊師利所將大眾，其中八千天子皆發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心。

When explained in these words, eight thousand gods from within the great assembly headed by Mañjuśrī all generated ***anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta***.
## CHAPTER SIX - *THE INCONCEIVABLE*

不思議品第六
Chapter Six: The Inconceivable

爾時舍利弗見此室中無有床座，作是念：「斯諸菩薩、大弟子眾，當於何坐？」

Then, Śāriputra saw that there were no seats in the room and he had this thought, ‘All these bodhisattvas and great disciples, where should they sit?’

長者維摩詰知其意，語舍利弗言：「云何仁者！為法來耶？求床座耶？」

The elder Vimalakīrti, knowing his thoughts, said to Śāriputra, “What is it, Venerable! Have you come for the Dharma? Or are you seeking a seat?

舍利弗言：「我為法來，非為床座。」

Śāriputra said, “I have come for the Dharma, not for a seat.”

維摩詰言：「唯，舍利弗！夫求法者，不貪軀命，何況床座？夫求法者，非有色、受、想、行、識之求，非有界、入之求，非有欲、色、無色之求。唯，舍利弗！夫求法者，不著佛求，不著法求，不著眾求；夫求法者，無見苦求，無斷集求，無造盡證、修道之求。所以者何？法無戲論，若言我當見苦、斷集、證滅、修道，是則戲論，非求法也。唯，舍利弗！法名寂滅，若行生滅，是求生滅，非求法也；法名無染，若染於法，乃至涅槃，是則染著，非求法也；法無行處，若行於法，是則行處，非求法也；法無取捨，若取捨法，是則取捨，非求法也；法無處所，若著處所，是則著處，非求法也；法名無相，若隨相識，是則求相，非求法也；法不可住，若住於法，是則住法，非求法也；法不可見、聞、覺知，若行見、聞、覺知，是則見、聞、覺知，非求法也；法名無為，若行有為，是求有為，非求法也。是故，舍利弗！若求法者，於一切法，應無所求。」

Vimalakīrti said, “Ah, Śāriputra! Those who seek the Dharma are not desirous of [even] life or limb, so what about a seat? Those who seek the Dharma seek [that which is] without form, sensation, perception, conditioning, or consciousness. They seek [that which is] without [there being sense] realms to enter. They seek [that which is] without desire, form, or formlessness. Ah, Śāriputra! Those who seek the Dharma seek without attachment to the Buddha. They seek without attachment to the Dharma. They seek without attachment to the Sangha. Those who seek the Dharma seek without seeing suffering. They seek without cutting off the accumulation [of suffering]. They seek without realizing the cessation [suffering] and without cultivating the [Eightfold] Path. How is it so? The Dharma is without contrived theories. If someone says that I should see suffering, cut off [its] accumulation, realize [its] cessation, and cultivate the Path, then this is just contrived theory and not seeking the Dharma. Ah, Śāriputra! The Dharma is called ‘calm cessation’ [*nirvāṇa*]. If one practices arising and ceasing, this is seeking arising and ceasing, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma is called ‘untainted’ [mixed, stained]. If one is ‘tainted’ in regard to *dharmas*, even up to *Nirvāṇa*, **this is tainted attachment, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma has no where to be practiced. If one practices somewhere, then that is somewhere to practice, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma is without grasping or letting go. If one grasps at or lets go of things (*dharmas*), then this is grasping and letting go, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma is not a refuge. If one needs a refuge, then that is a refuge, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma is called ‘characteristicless.’ If one’s consciousness flows in accord with characteristics this is seeking characteristics, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma is unable to abide. If one abides in *dharmas* then this is a ‘dharma abiding’, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma cannot be seen, heard, or understood. If one sees, hears, or understands, then this is seeing, hearing, and understanding, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma is [the] unconditioned. If one practices with[in] conditions this is seeking the conditioned, not seeking the Dharma. For this reason, Śāriputra! If one seeks the Dharma, one should not seek any thing (*dharma*) at all.”

說是語時，五百天子於諸法中得法眼淨。

When these words word spoken, five hundred godlings attained purification of their Dharma Eye in regard to all phenomena (*dharmas*).

爾時長者維摩詰，問文殊師利：「仁者遊於無量千萬億阿僧祇國，何等佛土有好上妙功德成就師子之座？」

Then the elder Vimalakīrti asked Mañjuśrī, “Venerable, in roaming throughout immeasurable thousands of ten thousands of millions of *asaṃkhyeyas* of lands, which Buddha Lands have the finest, most wonderful quality lion-throne seats?”

文殊師利言：「居士！東方度三十六恒河沙國，有世界名須彌相，其佛號須彌燈王，今現在。彼佛身長八萬四千由旬，其師子座高八萬四千由旬，嚴飾第一。」

Mañjuśrī said, “*Kulapati*! In the eastern direction, passing beyond lands as numerous as the sands of thirty-six Ganges Rivers, there is a world called *Sumeru-dhvaja* (’Sign of Mt. Meru’). It’s buddha is called Sumerupradīparāja (’Sumeru Lamp King’), who now appears there. That buddha’s body is eighty-four thousand *yojanas* tall and their lion-throne seat is eighty-four thousand yojanas high, the foremost in ornamentation.”

於是長者維摩詰現神通力，即時彼佛遣三萬二千師子座，高廣嚴淨，來入維摩詰室，諸菩薩、大弟子、釋、梵、四天王等，昔所未見。其室廣博，悉皆包容三萬二千師子座，無所妨礙。於毘耶離城，及閻浮提四天下，亦不迫迮，悉見如故。

At that, the elder Vimalakīrti manifested spiritual powers [performed a miracle] and then that buddha sent forth thirty-two thousand lion-throne seats - tall, wide, beautiful, and pure. They came and entered Vimalakīrti’s room. All the bodhisattvas, great disciples, Indra, Brahma, and the four heavenly kings and the others saw something they had never soon before. The room was broad and spacious enough to hold all these thirty-two thousand lion-throne seats without the slightest crowding or hindrance. The city of Vaiśālī, Jambudvipa and the four continents were also unmoved. Everything appeared just as it is.”

爾時維摩詰語文殊師利：「就師子座。」與諸菩薩上人俱坐，當自立身如彼座像。其得神通菩薩，即自變形為四萬二千由旬，坐師子座。諸新發意菩薩及大弟子皆不能昇。

Then Vimalakīrti told Mañjuśrī, “Have a lion-throne seat.” And when all the bodhisattvas and great people went to sit down they had to adjust the size of their bodies to be like the seats. The bodhisattvas who had attained supernatural powers (*siddhis*) then transformed themselves eighty-four thousand *yojanas* tall and sat down on the lion-throne seats. All the newly initiated bodhisattvas and all the great disciples, however, were unable to ascend [the thrones].

爾時維摩詰語舍利弗：「就師子座。」舍利弗言：「居士！此座高廣，吾不能昇。」

Then Vimalakīrti told Śāriputra, “Have a lion-throne seat.”

Śāriputra said, ‘*Kulapati*! This seat is way too high. I am unable to ascend [it].

維摩詰言：「唯，舍利弗！為須彌燈王如來作禮，乃可得坐。」於是新發意菩薩及大弟子即為須彌燈王如來作禮，便得坐師子座。

Vimalakīrti said, “Ah, Śāriputra! Make an offering to the Thus Come One Sumerupradīparāja, then you will be able to have a seat.”

At this, all the newly initiated bodhisattvas and the great disciples made offerings to the Thus Come One Merupradīparāja, and were then seated upon the lion-throne seats.

舍利弗言：「居士！未曾有也，如是小室，乃容受此高廣之座，於毘耶離城，無所妨礙，又於閻浮提聚落、城邑，及四天下諸天、龍王、鬼神宮殿，亦不迫迮。」

Śāriputra said, ‘*Kulapati*! This is unprecedented. Such a small room has made room for such high seats, and there is no hindrance in the city of Vaiśālī, nor any changes in the villages and cities of Jambudvipa, nor in any of the four continents, nor in the palaces of the devas, naga kings and spirits.”

維摩詰言：「唯，舍利弗！諸佛菩薩，有解脫，名不可思議。若菩薩住是解脫者，以須彌之高廣內芥子中無所增減，須彌山王本相如故，而四天王、忉利諸天不覺不知己之所入，唯應度者乃見須彌入芥子中，是名住不思議解脫法門。又以四大海水入一毛孔，不嬈魚、鼈、黿、鼉水性之屬，而彼大海本相如故，諸龍、鬼神、阿修羅等，不覺不知己之所入，於此眾生亦無所嬈。又，舍利弗！住不可思議解脫菩薩，斷取三千大千世界，如陶家輪，著右掌中，擲過恒河沙世界之外，其中眾生，不覺不知己之所往。又復還置本處，都不使人有往來想，而此世界本相如故。又，舍利弗！或有眾生，樂久住世而可度者，菩薩即延七日以為一劫，令彼眾生謂之一劫；或有眾生不樂久住，而可度者，菩薩即促一劫以為七日，令彼眾生謂之七日。又，舍利弗！住不可思議解脫菩薩，以一切佛土嚴飾之事，集在一國，示於眾生。又菩薩以一佛土眾生置之右掌，飛到十方遍示一切，而不動本處。又，舍利弗！十方眾生供養諸佛之具，菩薩於一毛孔，皆令得見。又十方國土所有日、月、星宿，於一毛孔普使見之。又，舍利弗！十方世界所有諸風，菩薩悉能吸著口中，而身無損，外諸樹木，亦不摧折。又十方世界劫盡燒時，以一切火內於腹中，火事如故，而不為害。又於下方過恒河沙等諸佛世界，取一佛土，舉著上方，過恒河沙無數世界，如持鍼鋒舉一棗葉，而無所嬈。又，舍利弗！住不可思議解脫菩薩，能以神通現作佛身，或現辟支佛身，或現聲聞身，或現帝釋身，或現梵王身，或現世主身，或現轉輪王身。又十方世界所有眾聲，上中下音，皆能變之，令作佛聲，演出無常、苦、空、無我之音。及十方諸佛所說種種之法，皆於其中普令得聞。舍利弗！我今略說菩薩不可思議解脫之力，若廣說者，窮劫不盡。」

Vimalakīrti said, “Ah, Śāriputra! All buddhas and bodhisattvas have a liberation (*vimokṣa*) called ‘Inconceivable’ (*Acintya*). For the bodhisattva who abides in this liberation, the height and the breadth of Sumeru may be placed inside a mustard seed without any increase or decrease. Since Sumeru, the king of mountains, maintains its original characteristics, the four great heavenly kings, and all the devas of the *trāyastriṃśas* are not aware, do not know that they have entered [a mustard seed]. Only those bound for the other shore see Mt. Sumeru enter into a mustard seed. This is called abiding in the ‘dharma door’ of the Inconceivable Liberation.”

“[One may] also cause the waters of the four great oceans to enter into a single hair pore without discomforting the fish, turtles, tortoises, crocodiles, and [other] aquatic life forms, and the original characteristics of those great oceans [remain just] as before. The nagas, spirits, and asuras do not realize that they have entered [into a single hair pore].  At this, all the sentient beings are not discomforted.”

“Also, Śāriputra! A bodhisattva abiding in the Inconceivable Liberation cuts off grasping the Three Thousand Great Thousand World System, and just like a potter grasping [their] wheel in their right palm, they throw it past world systems as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges River, and the sentient beings within are unaware of where they have gone. Also, when it returns to its original location, none of them have any perception of having gone or returned, and the original characteristics of these world systems are just as before.”

“Also, Śāriputra! If there are sentient beings who can be liberated through their desire for longevity, a bodhisattva will extend seven days into an entire *kalpa* and cause those sentient beings to consider it a *kalpa*. If there are sentient beings who can be liberated through their desire for brevity of lifespan, a bodhisattva will compress an entire *kalpa* into seven days and cause those sentient beings to consider it [only] seven days.”

“Also, Śāriputra! A bodhisattva abiding in the Inconceivable Liberation can accumulate the adornments of all buddha lands and manifest them to all sentient beings in a single country. Also, a bodhisattva can take the sentient beings of a buddha land in the right palm and fly to all ten directions, showing them everything, without moving from the original location.”

“Also, Śāriputra! A bodhisattva can make all the items offered to the buddhas by [all] the sentient beings throughout the ten directions visible in a single hair pore. Also, they can make visible all the suns, moons, and constellations of the countries of the ten directions.”

“Also, Śāriputra! A bodhisattva can inhale through the mouth all the winds of the world systems in the ten directions without harming the body, and all the trees outside not being damaged. Also, during the kalpa-ending conflagration by of the world systems of the ten directions, the can take all the fires within his abdomen, and though the fires will be as before they will not be harmed. Also, passing beyond buddha world systems in the lower direction more numerous than the sands of the Ganges River, they can take a single buddha land and lift it up in the upper direction, passing beyond world systems more numerous than the sands of the Ganges River, like they are holding a needle or a thorn, not inconvenienced [at all by doing so].”

“Also, Śāriputra! A bodhisattva abiding in the Inconceivable Liberation is able to use their spiritual powers to manifest the body of a buddha, or to manifest the body of a *pratyeka-buddha*, or to manifest the body of a *śrāvaka*, or to manifest the body of Indra, or to manifest the body of Brahma, or to manifest the body of a world lord, or to manifest the body of a wheel-turning sage king. They are also able to transform all the voices throughout the world systems - high, medium, and low - into the voices of the buddha, making the sounds of impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and no-self. Also, all the various kinds of Dharmas explained by the buddhas of the ten directions are heard everywhere in those sounds.”

“Śāriputra! I have now briefly explained the power of the bodhisattva’s Inconceivable Liberation. If I were to explain it extensively, a *kalpa* could pass and I would still not be finished.”

是時大迦葉聞說菩薩不可思議解脫法門，歎未曾有，謂舍利弗：「譬如有人，於盲者前現眾色像，非彼所見；一切聲聞聞是不可思議解脫法門，不能解了，為若此也！智者聞是，其誰不發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心？我等何為永絕其根，於此大乘，已如敗種！一切聲聞聞是不可思議解脫法門，皆應號泣，聲震三千大千世界；一切菩薩應大欣慶，頂受此法。若有菩薩信解不可思議解脫法門者，一切魔眾無如之何。」大迦葉說是語時，三萬二千天子皆發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心。

At that moment Mahākāśyapa, hearing this explanation of the bodhisattva’s Inconceivable Liberation, sighed at what he had never heard before and said to Śāriputra, “It is like someone putting various painted images before a blind person. They are not being seen. All the *śrāvakas* hear this Inconceivable Liberation Dharma Door, but they are unable to understand it, even though it’s there! If a wise person hears this, who wouldn’t generate *anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta*? How have we cut off our capacities for this Great Vehicle for so long, just like destroyed seeds? All the *śrāvakas*, hearing this Inconceivable Liberation Dharma Door, should all cry out with a voice that shakes the Three Thousand Great Thousand World System, and all the bodhisattvas should be anointed by joy at receiving this Dharma. If a bodhisattva is ‘faithfully liberated’ in the Inconceivable Liberation Dharma Door, what could the Hordes of Mara do?”

When Mahākāśyapa gave said these things, thirty-two thousand godlings all generated *anuttara-samyak-sambodhi citta.*             **

爾時維摩詰語大迦葉：「仁者！十方無量阿僧祇世界中作魔王者，多是住不可思議解脫菩薩。以方便力，教化眾生，現作魔王。又，迦葉！十方無量菩薩，或有人從乞手足耳鼻、頭目髓腦、血肉皮骨、聚落城邑、妻子奴婢、象馬車乘、金銀琉璃、車磲、馬碯、珊瑚、琥珀、真珠珂貝、衣服飲食，如此乞者，多是住不可思議解脫菩薩，以方便力，而往試之，令其堅固。所以者何？住不可思議解脫菩薩，有威德力，故現行逼迫，示諸眾生，如是難事；凡夫下劣，無有力勢，不能如是逼迫菩薩。譬如龍象蹴踏，非驢所堪，是名住不可思議解脫菩薩智慧方便之門。」

Then Vimalakīrti said to Mahākāśyapa, “Venerable! Those that make [act as] Mara Kings within immeasurable *asaṃkhyeya* world systems throughout the Ten Directions, many are bodhisattvas abiding in the Inconceivable Liberation. By the power of skillful means they teach and transform sentient beings, appearing to act as Mara Kings.”

“Also, Kāśyapa! The immeasurable Bodhisattvas throughout the Ten Directions - people come to them begging for a hand, a foot, an ear, or nose; their head, eyes, marrow or brains; blood, flesh, skin, and bone; their gatherings and settlements, their cities and states; their spouses and children, servants and slaves; elephants, horses, carts and vehicles; gold, silver, lapis lazuli, mother-of-pearl, agate, coral, and conch shells; cloth and clothing, drink and food - like this, people begging, many are bodhisattvas abiding in the Inconceivable Liberation. By the power of skillful means, they go to test the [bodhisattvas] resolve. How so? A bodhisattva abiding in the Inconceivable Liberation has awesome ‘virtue power’ and can, therefore, practice ‘compelling’, demonstrating such hardships of sentient beings. Ordinary people are inferior. They are without the power and unable to ‘compel’ bodhisattvas like this. It is just like the kicking or trampling of a dragon or elephant. No donkey could withstand it. This is called abiding in the gateway of bodhisattva’s Wisdom and Skillful Means of the Inconceivable Liberation.”
## CHAPTER SEVEN - *OBSERVING SENTIENT BEINGS*

觀眾生品第七
Chapter Seven: Observing Sentient Beings

爾時文殊師利問維摩詰言：「菩薩云何觀於眾生？」

Then Mañjuśrī asked Vimalakīrti, “How does a bodhisattva observe (perceive, regard, ‘in-see’, as in insight or *vipaśyanā*) a sentient being?”

維摩詰言：「譬如幻師，見所幻人，菩薩觀眾生為若此。如智者見水中月，如鏡中見其面像，如熱時焰，如呼聲響，如空中雲，如水聚沫，如水上泡，如芭蕉堅，如電久住，如第五大，如第六陰，如第七情，如十三入，如十九界，菩薩觀眾生為若此。如無色界色，如焦穀牙，如須陀洹身見，如阿那含入胎，如阿羅漢三毒，如得忍菩薩貪恚毀禁，如佛煩惱習，如盲者見色，如入滅盡定出入息，如空中鳥跡，如石女兒，如化人起煩惱，如夢所見已寤，如滅度者受身，如無烟之火，菩薩觀眾生為若此。」

Vimalakīrti said, “Just as an illusionist sees an illusory person, a bodhisattva observes a sentient being like this. As a sage sees the moon on the surface of water; as one sees the image of their own face in a mirror; as a shimmering mirage in the heat; as the echo of a cry; as a cloud in the sky; as foam on water; as the heartwood of a plantain tree; as abiding for only as long as lightning; as a fifth Great Element; as a sixth Aggregate; as a seventh sense; as a thirteenth entrance (*ayatana*), as a nineteenth realm (*dhatu*). A bodhisattva observes sentient beings like this. As formlessness within the realm of form; as a sprout from charred grain; as a *srota-āpanna* (’stream enterer’) with the view of self; as an *anāgāmin* (’non-returner’) entering a womb; as the three poisons of an arhat (’noble one’); as the broken prohibition against anger of a bodhisattva who has attained [the] patient tolerance; as the latent afflictions of a buddha; as a form seen by someone who is blind; as the inhalations and exhalations of someone who has entered the concentration of complete cessation; as the tracks of a bird in the sky; as the children of a barren woman; as the arisen afflictions of a ‘transformed person’ [i.e. as the erection of a eunuch]; as something seen in a dream by one who is already awake; as a fire without smoke. Bodhisattvas observe sentient beings like this.”

文殊師利言：「若菩薩作是觀者，云何行慈？」

Mañjuśrī said, “If a bodhisattva makes this observation [of] sentient beings, how do they practice *mettā* (*maitrī*, friendliness, loving-kindness)?

維摩詰言：「菩薩作是觀已，自念：『我當為眾生說如斯法。』是即真實慈也。行寂滅慈，無所生故；行不熱慈，無煩惱故；行等之慈，等三世故；行無諍慈，無所起故；行不二慈，內外不合故；行不壞慈，畢竟盡故；行堅固慈，心無毀故；行清淨慈，諸法性淨故；行無邊慈，如虛空故；行阿羅漢慈，破結賊故；行菩薩慈，安眾生故；行如來慈，得如相故；行佛之慈，覺眾生故；行自然慈，無因得故；行菩提慈，等一味故；行無等慈，斷諸愛故；行大悲慈，導以大乘故；行無厭慈，觀空無我故；行法施慈，無遺惜故；行持戒慈，化毀禁故；行忍辱慈，護彼我故；行精進慈，荷負眾生故；行禪定慈，不受味故；行智慧慈，無不知時故；行方便慈，一切示現故；行無隱慈，直心清淨故；行深心慈，無雜行故；行無誑慈，不虛假故；行安樂慈，令得佛樂故。菩薩之慈，為若此也。」

Vimalakīrti said, “A bodhisattva who has made this observation thinks, ‘I should explain this kind of Dharma to sentient beings.’ This is True Loving Kindness (*bhūtatathatā-maitrī*). Practicing the loving kindness of cessation, for there is nothing born; practicing the loving kindness of ‘no-heat’ (*atapa*), for being without affliction; practicing the loving kindness of equanimity, for the equanimity of the Triple World; practicing the loving kindness of non-contention, for being without arising; practicing the loving kindness of non-duality, for interior and exterior are not participated in; practicing the loving kindness of incorruptibility, for being completely exhausted; practicing the loving kindness of stability, for mind’s imperishability; practicing the loving kindness of purity, for the nature of all dharmas is pure; practicing infinite loving kindness, for being like empty space; practicing the loving kindness of an *arhat*, for having overcome all bondage and defeating all bandits; practicing the loving kindness of a bodhisattva, for [bringing] peace to all sentient beings; practicing the loving kindness of a Thus Come One, for having attained the characteristic of thusness; practicing the Buddha’s loving kindness, for the enlightened state of all sentient beings; practicing the loving kindness of naturally being, for there is no cause to attain; practicing the loving kindness of awakening (*bodhi*), for the equanimity of the ‘single flavor’; practicing the loving kindness of inequity [or non-equanimity], for cutting off *all* cravings; practicing the loving kindness of Great Compassion, for guiding by way of the Great Vehicle; practicing the loving kindness of non-revulsion, for observing emptiness without self; practicing the loving kindness of the Dharma of Giving, for never being stingy or regretful [about giving things away]; practicing the loving kindness of keeping Precepts, for those who would transgress them; practicing the loving kindness of Patient Tolerance, for protecting the selves of others; practicing the loving kindness of *Vīrya* determination, for carrying the burden of sentient beings; practicing the loving kindness of *Dhyāna* meditation, for not sensing flavor(s); practicing the loving kindness of *Prajñā* wisdom, for there never being a time of not knowing; practicing the loving kindness of *Upāya* skillful means, for making everything appear; practicing the loving kindness of not being concealed, for the purity of their upright mind [sincerity]; for practicing the loving kindness of a profound mind, for being without irrelevant practices; practicing the loving kindness of not being crazed, for not [using] false conventions; practicing the loving kindness of peace and joy, for making buddhas delight. The loving kindness of a bodhisattva is like this.”

文殊師利又問：「何謂為悲？」

Mañjuśrī again asked, “What is it to be compassionate (*karuṇā*)?

答曰：「菩薩所作功德，皆與一切眾生共之。」

He replied saying, “Whatever merit a bodhisattva makes is shared entirely with all sentient beings.”

「何謂為喜？」

“What is it to be joyful (*muditā*)?”

答曰：「有所饒益，歡喜無悔。」

He replied saying, “Whatever benefit there is, there is joy without regret.”

「何謂為捨？」

“What is it to relinquish (*upekṣā*)?”

答曰：「所作福祐，無所悕望。」

He replied saying, “Whatever fortune one is blessed with, it is without any expectation.”

文殊師利又問：「生死有畏，菩薩當何所依？」

Mañjuśrī again asked, “There is fear in birth & death (*saṃsāra*), upon what should the bodhisattva rely?”

維摩詰言：「菩薩於生死畏中，當依如來功德之力。」

Vimalakīrti said, “A bodhisattva within the fear of birth & death should rely upon the power of the merit of the Thus Come One.”

文殊師利又問：「菩薩欲依如來功德之力，當於何住？」

Mañjuśrī again asked, “How should a bodhisattva who wants to rely on upon the power of the merit of Thus Come One abide?”

答曰：「菩薩欲依如來功德力者，當住度脫一切眾生。」

He replied saying, “A bodhisattva who wants to rely on the power of the merit of Thus Come One should abide in liberating all sentient beings.”

又問：「欲度眾生，當何所除？」

[Mañjuśrī] again asked, “Wanting to liberate sentient beings, what should be eliminated?”

答曰：「欲度眾生，除其煩惱。」

[Vimalakīrti] replied saying, “Wanting to save sentient beings, eliminate the[ir] afflictions.”

又問：「欲除煩惱，當何所行？」

[Mañjuśrī] again asked, “Wanting to eliminate afflictions, what should be practiced?”

答曰：「當行正念。」

[Vimalakīrti] replied saying, “Right Mindfulness should be practiced.”

又問：「云何行於正念？」

[Mañjuśrī] again asked, “How does one practice Right Mindfulness?”

答曰：「當行不生不滅。」

[Vimalakīrti] replied saying, “Not arising and not ceasing should be practiced.”

又問：「何法不生？何法不滅？」

[Mañjuśrī] again asked, “What *dharma* does not arise? What *dharma* does not cease?”

答曰：「不善不生，善法不滅。」

[Vimalakīrti] replied saying, “Non-virtue does not arise. The virtuous dharma does not cease.”

又問：「善不善孰為本？」

[Mañjuśrī] again asked, “What is the origin of virtue and non-virtue?”

答曰：「身為本。」

[Vimalakīrti] replied saying, “The body is the origin.”

又問：「身孰為本？」

[Mañjuśrī] again asked, “What is the origin of the body?”

答曰：「欲貪為本。」

[Vimalakīrti] replied saying, “Craving (*taṇhā*) is the origin.”

又問：「欲貪孰為本？」

[Mañjuśrī] again asked, “What is the origin of craving?”

答曰：「虛妄分別為本。」

[Vimalakīrti] replied saying, “False discriminations is the origin.”

又問：「虛妄分別孰為本？」

[Mañjuśrī] again asked, “What is the origin of false discriminations?”

答曰：「顛倒想為本。」

[Vimalakīrti] replied saying, “Inverted perception is the origin.”

又問：「顛倒想孰為本？」

[Mañjuśrī] again asked, “What is the origin of inverted perception?

答曰：「無住為本。」

[Vimalakīrti] replied saying, “Not abiding is the origin.

又問：「無住孰為本？」

[Mañjuśrī] again asked, “What is the origin of not abiding?”

答曰：「無住則無本。文殊師利！從無住本，立一切法。」

[Vimalakīrti] replied saying, “Not abiding has no origin. Mañjuśrī! All dharmas are established upon the origin of not abiding.”

時維摩詰室有一天女，見諸大人聞所說法，便現其身，即以天華，散諸菩薩、大弟子上。華至諸菩薩，即皆墮落，至大弟子，便著不墮。一切弟子神力去華，不能令去。爾時天女問舍利弗：「何故去華？」

At that time, there was a goddess in Vimalakīrti’s room. Seeing all the great people explaining the Dharma, she made a bodily appearance and then showered all the bodhisattvas and great disciples with heavenly flowers. The flowers, falling on all the bodhisattvas, fell off. [When they] fell on the great disciples they became attached and didn’t fall [off]. Each of the disciples’ [tried to use] spiritual powers to remove the flowers, but they were unable to remove them. Then the goddess asked Śāriputra, “Why remove the flowers?”

答曰：「此華不如法，是以去之。」

He replied saying, “These flowers are not in accord with the Dharma. This is the reason to remove them.”

天曰：「勿謂此華為不如法。所以者何？是華無所分別，仁者自生分別想耳！若於佛法出家，有所分別，為不如法；若無所分別，是則如法。觀諸菩薩華不著者，已斷一切分別想故。譬如人畏時，非人得其便；如是弟子畏生死故，色、聲、香、味、觸得其便也。已離畏者，一切五欲無能為也；結習未盡，華著身耳！結習盡者，華不著也。」

The Goddess said, “Don’t say these flower are not in accord with the Dharma. For what reason? These flowers are undifferentiated. It is only the Venerable, himself, that gives rise to differentiated perception! If one has left their home for the Buddha Dharma, having such differentiation is not in accord with the Dharma. Observe all the bodhisattvas, to whom the flowers are not attached. It is because they have cut off all differentiated perceptions. It is just like when someone is afraid - the inhuman are able to control them. Like this, because the disciples fear birth & death (*saṃsāra*), visible forms, sounds, scents, flavors, and bodily sensations are able to control them. Each of the five desires is unable to affect one who has transcended fear. These flowers will remain attached to your body only as long as habitual entanglements have not been exhausted! The flowers do not become attached to those whose habitual entanglements have been exhausted.”

舍利弗言：「天止此室，其已久如？」

Śāriputra said, “For how long has the goddess has been abiding in this room ?”

答曰：「我止此室，如耆年解脫。」

[She] replied saying, “I have been abiding in this room for as long as the Elder has been liberated.”

舍利弗言：「止此久耶？」

Śāriputra said “Abiding *this* long?”

天曰：「耆年解脫，亦何如久？」

The Goddess asked, “How long has the Elder been liberated?”

舍利弗默然不答。天曰：「如何耆舊大智而默？」

Śāriputra was silent and did not reply. The Goddess asked, “What is the Elder’s great wisdom that he is silent?”

答曰：「解脫者無所言說，故吾於是不知所云。」

[Śāriputra ] replied saying, “There is nothing to be said about Liberation. For this reason, I did not know how to reply to this.”

天曰：「言說文字，皆解脫相。所以者何？解脫者，不內、不外，不在兩間，文字亦不內不外，不在兩間。是故，舍利弗！無離文字說解脫也。所以者何？一切諸法是解脫相。」

The Goddess said, “Words and speech, writing and letters, these are all characteristics of Liberation. How is it so? Liberation is not interior or exterior, nor somewhere between the two. Writing and letters are also neither interior nor exterior, nor somewhere between the two. For this reason, Śāriputra! Liberation does not transcend writing and letters. How is it so? Each and every *dharma* are the characteristic of Liberation.”

舍利弗言：「不復以離婬、怒、癡為解脫乎？」

Śāriputra said, “But isn’t Liberation the transcending of attraction, anger, and ignorance [i.e. the ‘Three Poisons’]?”

天曰：「佛為增上慢人，說離婬、怒、癡為解脫耳；若無增上慢者，佛說婬、怒、癡性，即是解脫。」

The Goddess said, “The Buddha only teaches that Liberation is the transcending of attraction, anger, and ignorance for people with excessive arrogance. If someone is without excessive amounts arrogance, the Buddha teaches that the very nature of attraction, anger, and ignorance is Liberation.”

舍利弗言：「善哉，善哉！天女！汝何所得？以何為證？辯乃如是！」

Śāriputra said, “Excellent, excellent! Goddess! What is it that you have attained? By what realization? That you are as eloquent as this!”

天曰：「我無得無證，故辯如是。所以者何？若有得有證者，即於佛法為增上慢。」

The Goddess said, “I am without attainment and without realization, for that reason I am as eloquent as this. How is it so? If I was one having attained, having realized, than I would be being excessively arrogant toward the Buddha Dharma.”

舍利弗問天：「汝於三乘，為何志求？」

Śāriputra asked the Goddess, “Of the three vehicles, which have you resolved to seek?”

天曰：「以聲聞法化眾生故，我為聲聞；以因緣法化眾生故，我為辟支佛；以大悲法化眾生故，我為大乘。舍利弗！如人入瞻蔔林，唯嗅瞻蔔，不嗅餘香。如是，若入此室，但聞佛功德之香，不樂聞聲聞、辟支佛功德香也。舍利弗！其有釋、梵、四天王，諸天、龍、鬼神等，入此室者，聞斯上人講說正法，皆樂佛功德之香，發心而出。舍利弗！吾止此室，十有二年，初不聞說聲聞、辟支佛法，但聞菩薩大慈大悲，不可思議諸佛之法。舍利弗！此室常現八未曾有難得之法。何等為八？此室常以金色光照，晝夜無異，不以日月所照為明，是為一未曾有難得之法；此室入者，不為諸垢之所惱也，是為二未曾有難得之法；此室常有釋梵四天王、他方菩薩來會不絕，是為三未曾有難得之法；此室常說六波羅蜜不退轉法，是為四未曾有難得之法；此室常作天人第一之樂，絃出無量法化之聲，是為五未曾有難得之法；此室有四大藏，眾寶積滿，賙窮濟乏，求得無盡，是為六未曾有難得之法；此室釋迦牟尼佛、阿彌陀佛、阿閦佛、寶德、寶炎、寶月、寶嚴、難勝、師子響、一切利成，如是等十方無量諸佛，是上人念時，即皆為來，廣說諸佛秘要法藏，說已還去，是為七未曾有難得之法；此室一切諸天嚴飾宮殿，諸佛淨土，皆於中現，是為八未曾有難得之法。舍利弗！此室常現八未曾有難得之法，誰有見斯不思議事，而復樂於聲聞法乎？」

The Goddess said, “Because I use the dharma of Voice Hearers to convert sentient beings, I am for the Voice Hearer (*śrāvaka*). Because I use the Dharma of Dependent Origination to convert sentient beings, I am for the solitary buddha (*pratyekabuddha*). As I use the Dharma of Great Compassion, I am for the Great Vehicle (Mahāyāna).”

“Śāriputra! Like someone who enters a forest of *campaka* (*Michelia champaka*). They will only be able to smell *campaka*, they will not smell other scents. Like this, if someone enters this room, they will only hear of scent of the merit of the Buddha. They will not delight in hearing about the scents of merit of voice hearers and solitary buddhas.”

“Śāriputra! Those Indras, Brahmas, four heavenly kings, all the devas, nagas, and other spirits who have entered this room to hear this superior person explain the Correct Dharma, they all delight in scent of the merit of the Buddha, and generate a mind set on bringing them about.”

“Śāriputra! I have been abiding in this room for twelve years. From the outset, I have not heard voice hearer of solitary buddha Dharma explained. I have only heard about the bodhisattva’s great kindness and great compassion, and all the inconceivable Dharma of the Buddha.”

“Śāriputra! This room constantly manifests eight unheard-of-before, hard to encounter Dharmas. What eight? This room is always illuminated with a golden light that doesn’t change, day or night; an illumination not of the Sun or Moon. This is the first unheard-of-before, hard to encounter Dharma. Those who enter this room are not afflicted by defilements. This is the second unheard-of-before, hard to encounter Dharma. This room always has Indras, Brahmas, the four heavenly kings, and bodhisattvas from their regions who come together uninterruptedly. This is the third unheard-of-before, hard to encounter Dharma. In this room the irreversible Dharma of the Six Paramitas is constantly explained. This is the fourth unheard-of-before, hard to encounter Dharma. This room constantly makes the foremost delightful music of heavenly beings which transforms into the immeasurable sound of the Dharma. This is the fifth unheard-of-before, hard to encounter Dharma.   This room has four great treasuries, filled with masses of jewels that are given to the poor and used to help those in need, without ever being depleted. This is the sixth unheard-of-before, hard to encounter Dharma. In this room, when this superior person [Vimalakīrti] is mindful of Śākyamuni Buddha, Amitābha Buddha, Akṣobhya Buddha, ‘Jewel Virtue’ (Ratnaśrī), ‘Jewel Mirage’ (Ratnācis), ‘Jewel Moon’ (Ratnacandra), ‘Jewel Array’ (Ratnayūha), ‘Difficult to Conquer’ (Sudurjayā), ‘Lion’s Echo’ (Siṃhakīrti), and Achieving All Benefits (Sarvārthasiddha), all the immeasurable buddhas of the ten directions such as these all come at once and broadly expound the secrets and essentials of the Dharma Treasury. And when they have finished explaining, they leave and return [to that direction]. This is the seventh unheard-of-before, hard to encounter Dharma. In this room appear all the decorated palaces of the heavens and all the pure lands of the Buddhas. This is the eighth unheard-of-before, hard to encounter Dharma.”

“Śāriputra! This room constantly manifests these eight unheard of before, hard to encounter Dharmas. Who could see these inconceivable things and still take delight in hearing voice hearer dharma?”             **

舍利弗言：「汝何以不轉女身？」

Śāriputra asked, “Why do you not change your female body?”

天曰：「我從十二年來，求女人相了不可得。當何所轉？譬如幻師化作幻女，若有人問：『何以不轉女身？』是人為正問不？」

The Goddess said, “For twelve years I have been seeking the characteristics of being a female and I have not found them. What is there to change? It is like an illusory female created by an illusionist. If someone were to ask, ‘Why do you not change your female body?’ would this person be asking a proper question, or not?”

舍利弗言：「不也！幻無定相，當何所轉？」

Śāriputra replied, “No! An illusion has no fixed characteristics. What is there to change?”

天曰：「一切諸法亦復如是，無有定相，云何乃問不轉女身？」

The Goddess said, “Each and every *dharma* is also like this, without any fixed characteristic. Why even ask about changing a female body?”

即時天女以神通力，變舍利弗令如天女，天自化身如舍利弗，而問言：「何以不轉女身？」

Then the Goddess used her spiritual power, transforming Śāriputra into the Goddess and herself into the body of Śāriputra, and then asked, “Why do you not change your female body?”

舍利弗以天女像而答言：「我今不知何轉而變為女身？」

Śāriputra, appearing to be as the Goddess, replied saying, “I don’t know how to change, or even how I was transformed into a female body.”

天曰：「舍利弗！若能轉此女身，則一切女人亦當能轉。如舍利弗非女而現女身，一切女人亦復如是，雖現女身，而非女也。是故佛說一切諸法非男、非女。」

The Goddess said, “Śāriputra! If you could change this female body, then all females should be able to change. As Śāriputra is not female, yet appears in a female body, each female is also like this. Though appearing in female bodies, they are not female. For this reason the Buddhas says all *dharmas* are neither male nor female.”

即時天女還攝神力，舍利弗身還復如故。天問舍利弗：「女身色相，今何所在？」

Then the Goddess withdrew her spiritual power and Śāriputra returned his original body. The Goddess then asked Śāriputra, “Where are the form and characteristics of the female body?”

舍利弗言：「女身色相，無在無不在。」

Śāriputra said, “The form and characteristics of the female body are nonexistent yet do not not exist”

天曰：「一切諸法，亦復如是，無在無不在。夫無在無不在者，佛所說也。」

The Goddess said, “Each and every *dharma* is also like this, nonexistent yet not not existing.  Nonexistence yet not not existing is what the Buddha has explained.”

舍利弗問天：「汝於此沒，當生何所？」

Śāriputra asked the Goddess, “When you pass away from here, where will you be (re)born?”

天曰：「佛化所生，吾如彼生。」

The Goddess said, “As buddhas are born by transformation, I will be reborn like that.”

曰：「佛化所生，非沒生也。」

[Śāriputra] replied, “The birth of buddhas by transformation is not passing away and being reborn.”

天曰：「眾生猶然，無沒生也。」

The Goddess said, “Sentient beings are as well, without passing away or being reborn.”

舍利弗問天：「汝久如當得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提？」

Śāriputra asked the Goddess, “How long will it be until you attain ***anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi**?”*

天曰：「如舍利弗還為凡夫，我乃當成阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。」

The Goddess said, “I will have accomplished ***anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi*** when Śāriputra returns to being a lay person.”

舍利弗言：「我作凡夫，無有是處。」

Śāriputra said, “For me to be a lay person, this could not take place.”

天曰：「我得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提，亦無是處。所以者何？菩提無住處，是故無有得者。」

The Goddess said, “My attaining ***anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi***, this could also not take place. How is it so? *Bodhi* (awakening) is without a place of abiding, for this reason there is no one to attain it.”

舍利弗言：「今諸佛得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提，已得當得，如恒河沙，皆謂何乎？」

Śāriputra said, “All the buddhas who are now attaining, have attained, or will attain ***anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi***, like the sand of the Ganges River - What about all of them?”

天曰：「皆以世俗文字數故，說有三世，非謂菩提有去來今。」

The Goddess said, “It is entirely through conventional letters (or words) and numbers that is said there is a Triple World (past, future, and present). It is not to say that *Bodhi* goes, comes, or is.”

天曰：「舍利弗！汝得阿羅漢道耶？」

The Goddess said, “Śāriputra! Have you attained the Way of Arhatship?

曰：「無所得故而得。」

[He] replied, “Since there is nothing to attain, it is attained.”

天曰：「諸佛、菩薩亦復如是，無所得故而得。」

The Goddess said, “All buddhas and bodhisattvas are also like this. Since there is nothing to attain, it is attained.”

爾時維摩詰語舍利弗：「是天女已曾供養九十二億佛，已能遊戲菩薩神通，所願具足，得無生忍，住不退轉；以本願故，隨意能現，教化眾生。」

At this time Vimalakīrti said to Śāriputra, “This Goddess has already made offerings to ninety-two million buddhas and can roam about in the spiritual penetrations of the bodhisattva, her vows completed, having attained the patient tolerance of the birthlessness [of all dharmas]. Because of her original vow she appears [at will] in accord with the mind in order to teach and transform sentient beings.
## CHAPTER EIGHT - *THE WAY OF THE BUDDHA*

佛道品第八
Chapter Eight: The Way of the Buddha

爾時文殊師利問維摩詰言：「菩薩云何通達佛道？」

At that time, Mañjuśrī asked Vimalakīrti, “ How do bodhisattvas enter the ***Way of the Buddha***?” **

維摩詰言：「若菩薩行於非道，是為通達佛道。」

Vimalakīrti said, “If bodhisattvas practice (tread, walk, act, behave, condition, etc..) where there is no way, this is to enter the ***Way of the Buddha***.”

又問：「云何菩薩行於非道？」

[Mañjuśrī ] again asked, “How do bodhisattvas practice where there is no way?”

答曰：「若菩薩行五無間，而無惱恚；至于地獄，無諸罪垢；至于畜生，無有無明憍慢等過；至于餓鬼，而具足功德；行色、無色界道，不以為勝。示行貪欲，離諸染著；示行瞋恚，於諸眾生，無有恚閡；示行愚癡，而以智慧，調伏其心。示行慳貪，而捨內外所有，不惜身命；示行毀禁，而安住淨戒，乃至小罪，猶懷大懼；示行瞋恚，而常慈忍；示行懈怠，而懃修功德；示行亂意，而常念定；示行愚癡，而通達世間、出世間慧；示行諂偽，而善方便，隨諸經義；示行憍慢，而於眾生，猶如橋梁；示行諸煩惱，而心常清淨；示入於魔，而順佛智慧，不隨他教；示入聲聞，而為眾生，說未聞法；示入辟支佛，而成就大悲，教化眾生；示入貧窮，而有寶手，功德無盡；示入刑殘，而具諸相好，以自莊嚴；示入下賤，而生佛種姓中，具諸功德；示入羸劣醜陋，而得那羅延身，一切眾生之所樂見；示入老病，而永斷病根，超越死畏；示有資生，而恒觀無常，實無所貪；示有妻妾采女，而常遠離五欲淤泥；現於訥鈍，而成就辯才，總持無失；示入邪濟，而以正濟，度諸眾生；現遍入諸道，而斷其因緣；現於涅槃，而不斷生死。文殊師利！菩薩能如是行於非道，是為通達佛道。」

[Vimalakīrti] replied saying, “If bodhisattvas commit the Five Interminables (*pañcānantarya*), yet are without the affliction of hatred; arrive in a hell realm without the defilement of transgression; are reborn as animals without faults such as ignorance and conceit; arrive [as] hungry ghosts, yet are replete with merit; and practice (walk) ways (paths) within the realms of Form and Formlessness without considering it a victory; appear to act desirously, free of all defiling attachments; appear to act angry toward all sentient beings, without there being animosity; and appear to act ignorantly and confused, yet use wisdom to discipline their minds. Appear to act greedily, yet relinquish both interior and exterior existents without begrudging the body or life; Appear to be transgressive, yet peacefully abide in pure precepts so that even the slightest fault is considered something to be greatly feared; Appear to act hatefully, yet constantly [practice] patient tolerance (*kṣānti*); Appear to be lazy (*kausīdya*), yet diligently cultivate merit; Appear to act scatterbrained, yet are ever mindfully attentive; Appear to be ignorant, yet penetrate both mundane and transcendent wisdom; Appear to be flattering and fake, yet with excellent skillful means that are in accord with the meaning of all the sutras; Appear to be arrogant, yet are like bridges to sentient beings; Appear to behave with all of the afflictions, yet have ever pure minds; Appear to become Māras, yet heed the wisdom of the Buddha, not following another teaching; Appear to become voice-hearers, yet explain Dharma not heard before for sentient beings; Appear to become *pratyekabuddha*s, yet accomplish the Great Compassion and teach sentient beings; Appear to become poor, yet have the ‘Jewel Hand’ of inexhaustible merit; Appear to become maimed and/or crippled, yet become ‘self adorned’ with all of the auspicious characteristics; Appear to become ***lowly***, yet are born within the lineage (family, **seed**, kind) of the Buddhas, replete with all merit; Appear to become feeble and ugly, yet have the body of Nārāyaṇa (Viṣṇu), which all sentient beings enjoy seeing; Appear to become old and sick, yet have eternally cut off the root of illness and transcend the fear of death; Appear to have wealth, yet only observe impermanence, truly without any desire; Appear to have spouses and lovers, yet are ever free of the filth of the mire of the five desires; Manifest as mute and dumb, yet accomplish eloquence and [*dhāraṇī*] retention without error; Appear to be false ‘crossings’, yet are proper (correct) ‘crossings’ by delivering (’saving’, liberating) all sentient beings; Manifest entering all destinies, yet cut off their conditionality; Manifest entering Nirvana, yet without cutting off birth & death. Mañjuśrī! Bodhisattvas able to ‘walk’ where there is no way like this, this is to enter the ***Way of the Buddha***.”

於是維摩詰問文殊師利：「何等為如來種？」

At this, Vimalakīrti asked Mañjuśrī: “What are the ‘**seeds**’ (lineage, family, kind) of the Thus Come One (*tathāgata-vaṃśa*)?”

文殊師利言：「有身為種，無明有愛為種，貪恚癡為種，四顛倒為種，五蓋為種，六入為種，七識處為種，八邪法為種，九惱處為種，十不善道為種。以要言之，六十二見及一切煩惱，皆是佛種。」

Mañjuśrī said, “Having a body is a seed. Ignorance and Desire are seeds. Attraction, Aversion and Confusion [the ‘three poisons’] are seeds. The Four Inversions are seeds. The Five Aggregates are seeds. The Six Entrances (senses) are seeds. The Seven Bases of Consciousnesses are seeds. The Eight Ignoble Dharmas are seeds. The Nine Bases of Affliction are seeds. The Ten Non-Virtuous Ways are seeds. Essentially speaking, the Sixty-Two [erroneous] Views and each of the Afflictions are all the seeds of Buddha[hood].”

曰：「何謂也？」

Vimalakīrti replied, “Which is to say what?”

答曰：「若見無為入正位者，不能復發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心；譬如高原陸地，不生蓮華，卑濕淤泥乃生此華；如是見無為法入正位者，終不復能生於佛法；煩惱泥中，乃有眾生起佛法耳！又如殖種於空，終不得生！糞壤之地，乃能滋茂。如是入無為正位者，不生佛法；起於我見如須彌山，猶能發于阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，生佛法矣！是故當知，一切煩惱，為如來種。譬如不下巨海，不能得無價寶珠。如是不入煩惱大海，則不能得一切智寶。」

[Mañjuśrī] replied saying, “One who enters Correct Understanding, seeing the Unconditioned, is unable to attain ***anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi*** ***citta***. Just as the dry land on a high plateau will not give rise to a lotus flower, a flower that grows in the mud and mire of ***low-lying*** places; Like this, those who enter Correct Understanding seeing the Unconditioned are forever unable to give rise to Buddha Dharma. It is only within the mud of the afflictions that sentient beings give rise to Buddha Dharma! It is also like planting a seed in the air, it will never germinate! Only in manure-enriched earth can it sprout and flourish. Like this, one who enters the Unconditioned Correct Understanding will not give rise to Buddha Dharma. It is only when one brings forth the view of themselves as being like Mt. Sumeru that they are able to generate the intention to achieve ***anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi*** ***citta***, and give rise to Buddha Dharma. For this reason you should know, each of the afflictions are seeds of the Thus Come One. It is just like not going to the depths of the ocean, you will be unable to attain priceless jewel-pearls. Like this, if you do not enter the Great Sea of Afflictions, then you will be unable to attain any Jewels of Wisdom.                ******

爾時大迦葉歎言：「善哉，善哉！文殊師利！快說此語。誠如所言，塵勞之疇為如來種；我等今者，不復堪任發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，乃至五無間罪，猶能發意生於佛法，而今我等永不能發。譬如根敗之士，其於五欲不能復利。如是聲聞諸結斷者，於佛法中無所復益，永不志願。是故，文殊師利！凡夫於佛法有返復，而聲聞無也。所以者何？凡夫聞佛法，能起無上道心，不斷三寶。正使聲聞終身聞佛法，力、無畏等，永不能發無上道意。」

At that time Mahākāśyapa sighed and said, “Excellent! Excellent! Mañjuśrī! These words aptly explain. Indeed, as you have said, the field of troublesome ‘dust’ is the seed of the Thus Come One. Now, we are no longer able to bear generating ***anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi*** ***citta.*** Even those who commit the Five Interminables could generate such a mind toward Buddha Dharma, however we now will forever never be able to generate [***bodhi*** ***citta***]. Just like someone with impaired faculties, unable to benefit from the five (sense) pleasures. Like this, Voice Hearers who have cut off all fetters are without any benefit though being among all the Buddha Dharma, and will never have a will to be so. For this reason, Mañjuśrī! The ordinary person has a response to Buddha Dharma, yet the Voice Hearer is without one. How is it so? An ordinary person hears the Buddha Dharma and they are able to give rise to an unsurpassable mind of enlightenment, without cutting off the Three Jewels. Even if a Voice Hearer spent their entire life hearing about the Dharmas of Buddha, the Powers, the Fearlessnesses, etc., they would be forever unable to generate a thought of unsurpassable enlightenment.”

爾時會中有菩薩，名普現色身，問維摩詰言：「居士！父母妻子、親戚眷屬、吏民知識，悉為是誰？奴婢僮僕、象馬車乘，皆何所在？」

Then, among the assembly a bodhisattva called Universally Manifesting Form Body (Sarvarūpasaṃdarśana) asked Vimalakīrti, “Householder (*Kulapati*)! Father, mother, spouse and child, kinfolk and acquaintances, messengers and friends, who are they? Your attendants and servants, elephants and horses, carriages and vehicles, where are they all?”

於是維摩詰以偈答曰：

To which Vimalakīrti replied in verse saying:

智度菩薩母，　　
方便以為父，　
一切眾導師，　　
無不由是生。

Perfect Wisdom is the mother of bodhisattvas
Skillful Means is the father.
Of those who guide and teach,
None are not born of them.

法喜以為妻，　　
慈悲心為女，　
善心誠實男，　　
畢竟空寂舍。

Dharma Joy is their spouse,
Loving Kindness and Compassion their daughters,
A Virtuous Mind and Sincerity are their sons,
And Ultimate Emptiness is their home.  　

弟子眾塵勞，　　
隨意之所轉，　
道品善知識，　　
由是成正覺。

Their disciples are the gathering of troublesome ‘dust’
‘Converted’ into ‘following’ their thoughts,
The [37] Aids to the Way are their teacher-friends (*kalyāṇamitra*),
Only by them do they achieve Correct Awakening.    　

諸度法等侶，　　
四攝為伎女，　
歌詠誦法言，　　
以此為音樂。

Liberating Dharmas are their ‘group’,
The Four Means of Unification their ‘back-up singers’,
Who sing songs praising the Dharma,
In this way making their music.  　

總持之園苑，　　
無漏法林樹，　
覺意淨妙華，　　
解脫智慧果。

In the garden of their memory [*dhāraṇīs,* retention],
Is a grove of Dharma with no outflows,
Where pure, sublime flowers of the Enlightened Mind
Fruit Liberation and Wisdom.

八解之浴池，　　
定水湛然滿，　
布以七淨華，　　
浴此無垢人。

Pools of Eight Liberations,
Filled with tranquil waters of concentration,
Scattered with flowers of the Seven Purities,
Are where the ‘stainless’ person bathes.

象馬五通馳，　　
大乘以為車，　
調御以一心，　　
遊於八正路。

Their elephants and horses are racing the Five Penetrations (Powers),
The Great Vehicle is their carriage.
Steering them with single-mindedness,
They roam the Eight Correct roads　

相具以嚴容，　　
眾好飾其姿，　
慚愧之上服，　　
深心為華鬘。

[The 32] Perfected Characteristics are their ‘adorned physique’ [undergarment]
[The 80] Good Signs their ‘looks’ [middle garment]
A sense of shame is their upper garment
A profound mind their flower mala [wreath, headdress]   　

富有七財寶，　　
教授以滋息，　
如所說修行，　　
迴向為大利。

Their wealth is the Seven Treasures,
Which they bestow by teaching the taste of breathing,
Cultivating practice as has been explained
And transferring it for the Great Benefit.

四禪為床座，　　
從於淨命生，　
多聞增智慧，　　
以為自覺音。

The Four *Dhyānas* are their bed,
From which they perform Right Livelihood,
Hearing (learning) much, their Wisdom increases
By the sound of their own enlightenment.  **

甘露法之食，　　
解脫味為漿，　
淨心以澡浴，　　
戒品為塗香。

Their food is the sweet dew of the Dharma,
The flavor of Liberation, their drink.
A Pure Mind is their bathing tub
They use the Precepts as their perfume.

摧滅煩惱賊，　　
勇健無能踰，　
降伏四種魔，　　
勝幡建道場。

Thwarting the bandits of the Afflictions,
With invincible courage,
They subjugate the Hordes of Mara
And set their Banner of Victory upon the Site of Enlightenment.    　

雖知無起滅，　　
示彼故有生，　
悉現諸國土，　　
如日無不見。

Though knowing there is no arising and ceasing
In order to demonstrate that, they are born,
Manifesting throughout all Countries,
Like the sun, nowhere not seen.  　

供養於十方，　　
無量億如來，　
諸佛及己身，　　
無有分別想。

Making offerings throughout the Ten Directions,
To immeasurable millions of Thus Come Ones,
Between all Buddhas and their own bodies,
They do not perceive their being a difference,

雖知諸佛國，　　
及與眾生空，　
而常修淨土，　　
教化於群生。

Through knowing that all Buddha lands
and all sentient beings are empty,
They constantly cultivate the purification of lands
Teaching and transforming all kinds of beings.

諸有眾生類，　　
形聲及威儀，　
無畏力菩薩，　　
一時能盡現。

All the various types of sentient beings,
Their shapes, sounds, and behaviors,
The fearless bodhisattva
In a single moment manifests them all.

覺知眾魔事，　　
而示隨其行，　
以善方便智，　　
隨意皆能現。

Enlightened to the activities of the Hordes of Mara,
They appear to go along with their practices,
By the Knowledge of virtuous Skillful Means
They are able to manifest according to their mind.

或示老病死，　　
成就諸群生，　
了知如幻化，　　
通達無有礙。

Or they appear to get old, get sick, and die,
In order to mature all kinds of beings,
[Performing] such comprehension of illusory transformations
Penetrating without obstruction.　

或現劫盡燒，　　
天地皆洞然，　
眾人有常想，　　
照令知無常。

Or manifesting as the *kalpa*-ending conflagration,
In which heaven and earth are entirely incinerated,
To all beings with the perception of permanence,
Making presently clear the knowledge of impermanence.

無數億眾生，　　
俱來請菩薩，　
一時到其舍，　　
化令向佛道。

Incalculable millions of sentient beings,
All come inquiring of the bodhisattva,
At the same time arriving at their home,
Being transformed to the ***Way of the Buddha***

經書禁呪術，　　
工巧諸伎藝，　
盡現行此事，　　
饒益諸群生。

Classics and books, forbidden spells and magical arts,
Works and crafts and all the arts,
They manifest the practice of these activities,
For the benefit of all kinds of beings.

世間眾道法，　　
悉於中出家，　
因以解人惑，　　
而不墮邪見。

Of all the world’s Dharmic Ways,
In all of them they leave home,
In order to liberate people from delusion
And not fall into erroneous views.

或作日月天，　　
梵王世界主，　
或時作地水，　　
或復作風火。

Or they become Gods of the Sun or Moon,
Brahma Kings, or World Leaders
Or at times they become Earth or Water,
Or further becoming Wind or Fire.

現作諸藥草，

除病消眾毒。

When there are epidemics in the middle of a *kalpa*,
They become medicinal plants,
Which, if someone takes them,
Eliminates all illness and poisons.

劫中有飢饉，　　
現身作飲食，

却以法語人。

Then telling them about the Dharma.

They give rise to a mind of loving kindness toward them,
Transforming all sentient beings
To abide in the Stage of Non-contention.

立之以等力，　
菩薩現威勢，　　
降伏使和安。

If there are great armies,
Standing with equal power,
Bodhisattvas manifest being awesome,
Subjugating them and imposing peace.

一切國土中，　　
諸有地獄處，　
輒往到于彼，　　
勉濟其苦惱。

To every land and nation,
Anywhere there are Hell Realms,
They journey to those places,
And endeavor to alleviate the suffering there.

畜生相食噉，　
皆現生於彼，　　
為之作利益。

To every land and nation,
Where beasts devour each other,
They manifest being born everyway
In order to be of benefit to them. 　

示受於五欲，　　
亦復現行禪，　
令魔心憒亂，　　
不能得其便。

They demonstrate experiencing the Five Desires,
Yet also appear to practice *dhyana*,
Causing Mara’s mind to be confused,
Unable to be in control.   　

火中生蓮華，　　
是可謂希有，　
在欲而行禪，　　
希有亦如是。

A lotus flower born in fire,
Is indeed rare to find,
To practice *dhyana* within desire.
Is as rare as this.

或現作婬女，　　
引諸好色者，　
先以欲鉤牽，　　
後令入佛道。

Or they appear as prostitutes,
Drawing out all those who enjoy beauty
First catching them with the hook of desire,
Then later having them enter the ***Way of the Buddha.***

國師及大臣，　　
以祐利眾生。

Or as a village master,

As Immortals of the Five Penetrations (powers),

現為作僮僕，　
既悅可其意，　　
乃發以道心。

Seeing those in need of assistance,
They manifest as servants,
By delighting their minds by their capabilities,
It makes them generate a Mind of the Way.

皆能給足之。

In accord with the needs of others,
They attain entry to the ***Way of the Buddha***.  　
By the power of their virtuous skillful means,
All are provided with sufficiency.

智慧無邊際，　　
度脫無數眾。

Like this, the ***Ways*** are immeasurable,
Practiced (’walked’, tread,) without boundaries (’shores’)
Wisdom without limits
Ferrying to liberation incalculable beings. 　

假令一切佛，　　
於無量億劫，　
讚歎其功德，　　
猶尚不能盡。

Suppose each of the Buddhas,
Throughout immeasurable billions of *kalpas*,
Praised their virtue,
They could never do so completely.

誰聞如是法，　　
不發菩提心，　
除彼不肖人，　　
癡冥無智者。

Who upon hearing Dharma like this,
Does not generate Bodhicitta?

## CHAPTER NINE - *ENTERING THE DHARMA DOOR OF NONDUALITY*

入不二法門品第九
Chapter Nine: Entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality

爾時維摩詰謂眾菩薩言：「諸仁者！云何菩薩入不二法門？各隨所樂說之。」

Then Vimalakirti said to the gathering of bodhisattvas, “Venerables! How does a bodhisattva enter the Dharma Door of Nonduality? Let each of you explain as you wish.”

會中有菩薩名法自在，說言：「諸仁者！生滅為二。法本不生，今則無滅，得此無生法忍，是為入不二法門。」

Within the assembly there was a bodhisattva called Sovereignty of the Dharma (Dharmavikurvaṇa) who said, “Venerables! “Arising [or birth] (*utpāda*) and ceasing [or extinction] (*nirodha*) make a duality. Dharma fundamentally do not arise [are not born], therefore there is no cessation. Attaining this *anutpattika-dharma-kṣānti* (“Patient Tolerance of the Birthlessness [or Nonarising] of Phenomena”]  is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

德守菩薩曰：「我、我所為二。因有我故，便有我所；若無有我，則無我所，是為入不二法門。」

Merit Guardian Bodhisattva (Śrīgandha) said, “’I’ and ‘Mine’ make a duality. Since there is an ‘I’, then there is a ‘Mine’. Yet, if there is no ‘I’, then there is no ‘Mine' - this is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

不眴菩薩曰：「受、不受為二。若法不受，則不可得；以不可得，故無取無捨、無作無行，是為入不二法門。」

Unblinking Bodhisattva (*Animiṣa*) said, “Sensing (*vedana*) and not sensing make a duality. If *dharma* are not sensed (received or made contact with) then they cannot be attained (’felt’). And by there being nothing attainable, there is no grasping and no relinquishing, no doing and no habituation (*saṃskāra*), and this is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

德頂菩薩曰：「垢、淨為二。見垢實性，則無淨相，順於滅相，是為入不二法門。」

Crown of Merit (Śrīkūṭa) Bodhisattva said, “Defiled (*saṃkleśa*) and pure (*vyavadāna*) make a duality. Seeing the true nature of defilement, then there is no[thing to have the] characteristic of purity. Being in accord with the cessation of characteristics, this is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

善宿菩薩曰：「是動、是念為二。不動則無念，無念則無分別。通達此者，是為入不二法門。」

Fortunate Constellation (Bhadrajyotis) Bodhisattva said, “To be moved (*vikṣepa* or stirred) and to be mindful (*manyanā*, i.e. ‘still’) make a duality. If there is no movement then there is no mind[ing], and without mind[ing] there is no discrimination. To penetrate this is to enter the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

善眼菩薩曰：「一相、無相為二。若知一相即是無相，亦不取無相，入於平等，是為入不二法門。」

Excellent Eye (Sunetra) Bodhisattva said, “The single characteristic  (*ekalakṣaṇa*) and characteristiclessness (*alakṣaṇa*) make a duality. If one knows the single characteristic is characteristicless, and does not cling to characteristiclessness, entering equanimity (*samata*), this is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.

妙臂菩薩曰：「菩薩心、聲聞心為二。觀心相空，如幻化者，無菩薩心、無聲聞心，是為入不二法門。」

“Wonderful Arm (Subāhu) Bodhisattva said, “The mind of a bodhisattva and the mind of a voice hearer make a duality. Observing that the characteristics of mind are empty, like illusory transformations, without a mind of a bodhisattva, without a mind of a voice hearer, this is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

弗沙菩薩曰：「善、不善為二。若不起善、不善，入無相際而通達者，是為入不二法門。」

Puṣya Bodhisattva said, “Good (or ’excellent’) and not good make a duality. If one does not give rise to the good and what is not good, entering into and penetrating the limit of characteristiclessness, this is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

師子菩薩曰：「罪、福為二。若達罪性，則與福無異，以金剛慧決了此相，無縛無解者，是為入不二法門。」

Lion Bodhisattva (Siṃha) said, “Blame (*sāvadya*) and blessing (*anavadya*) make a duality. If one penetrates the nature of blame, it is no different than that of blessing. Being unbound and liberated by Vajra Wisdom that definitively understands this characteristic is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

師子意菩薩曰：「有漏、無漏為二。若得諸法等，則不起漏、不漏想，不著於相，亦不住無相，是為入不二法門。」

Lion Mind Bodhisattva (Siṃhamati) said, “Having outflows (*sāsrava*) and being without outflows (*anāsrava*) make a duality. If one attains the equality (*samatā*) of all *dharma*, one does not give rise to the perception (*saṃjñā*) of outflows or being without outflows. Being unattached to characteristics yet not abiding in characteristiclessness is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

淨解菩薩曰：「有為、無為為二。若離一切數，則心如虛空，以清淨慧無所礙者，是為入不二法門。」

Pure Liberation Bodhisattva (Śuddhāmukti) said, “The conditioned and the unconditioned make a duality. If one transcends categorization, the mind is like space, and pure wisdom without obstruction is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

那羅延菩薩曰：「世間、出世間為二。世間性空，即是出世間。於其中不入、不出、不溢、不散，是為入不二法門。」

Nārāyaṇa Bodhisattva said, “Worldly (*laukika*) and transcendent (*lokotara*) make a duality. The nature of the world is empty, so too is transcendence. To neither enter nor exit, nor go beyond, nor settle within them is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

善意菩薩曰：「生死、涅槃為二。若見生死性，則無生死，無縛無解，不生不滅，如是解者，是為入不二法門。」

Virtuous Mind Bodhisattva (Dāntamati) said, “Samsara (’birth and death’) and Nirvana make a duality. One who sees that the nature (*svabhāva*) of birth and death is without birth or death, without bondage or liberation, neither arisen nor ceased. Being liberated like this is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

現見菩薩曰：「盡、不盡為二。法若究竟，盡若不盡，皆是無盡相；無盡相即是空，空則無有盡不盡相。如是入者，是為入不二法門。」

Manifesting Sight Bodhisattva (Pratyakṣadarśana) said, “Exhaustible (*kṣaya*) and inexhaustible (*akṣaya*) make a duality.  Whether *dharmas* are ultimately exhaustible or inexhaustible, they are all without the characteristic of exhaustibility. Being without the characteristic of exhaustibility is Emptiness and Emptiness is without the characteristics of exhaustibility or inexhaustibility. Entering like this is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

普守菩薩曰：「我、無我為二。我尚不可得，非我何可得？見我實性者，不復起二，是為入不二法門。」

Universal Guardian Bodhisattva (Pariguḍha) said, “Self (*ātman*) and No-Self (*anātman*) make a duality. A self cannot even be attained (found), how could a ‘not self’ be attained? Seeing the Real Nature of the self, not giving further rise to duality, this is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

電天菩薩曰：「明、無明為二。無明實性即是明，明亦不可取，離一切數，於其中平等無二者，是為入不二法門。」

Thunder Deva Bodhisattva (Vidyuddeva) said, “Illuminated (*vidyā,* wisdom) and unilluminated ( *avidyā,* Ignorance) make a duality. The Real Nature of the unilluminated is illuminated, for illumination can also not be grasped and transcends all measurement. Being within their equality, without duality, is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

喜見菩薩曰：「色、色空為二。色即是空，非色滅空，色性自空。如是受、想、行、識、識空為二，識即是空，非識滅空，識性自空，於其中而通達者，是為入不二法門。」

Joyful Sight Bodhisattva (Priyadarśana) said, “Form and the emptiness of form make a duality. Form is just empty. Not by the emptiness of the cessation (or destruction) of form, form is empty by its very nature. Like this, sensation, perception, conditioning, consciousness, and the emptiness of consciousness make dualities. Consciousness is just empty. Not by the emptiness of the cessation of consciousness, consciousness is empty by its very nature. Penetrating the middle of these is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

明相菩薩曰：「四種異、空種異為二。四種性即是空種性，如前際、後際空，故中際亦空。若能如是知諸種性者，是為入不二法門。」

Sign of Illumination Bodhisattva (Prābhaketu) said “Differentiating the Four Elements and differentiating them from the element Space make dualities. The nature of the Four Elements is the nature of the element Space; empty, like the future and past, the in between (i.e. present) is also empty. To know the nature of all elements like this is to enter the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

妙意菩薩曰：「眼、色為二。若知眼性，於色不貪、不恚、不癡，是名寂滅。如是耳聲、鼻香、舌味、身觸、意法為二，若知意性，於法不貪、不恚、不癡，是名寂滅，安住其中，是為入不二法門。」

Wonderful Mind Bodhisattva (Pramati) said, “The Eye and form make dualities. If one knows the nature of the eye, not being desirous, averse, or confused about form, this is called tranquil cessation. Like this, the ear and sounds, the nose and scents, the tongue and flavors, the body and feelings, the mind and ideas (*dharmas*), make dualities. Knowing the nature of the mind, not desirous of, averse to, or confused about ideas is called tranquil cessation, which peacefully abiding within is called entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

無盡意菩薩曰：「布施、迴向一切智為二。布施性即是迴向一切智性，如是持戒、忍辱、精進、禪定、智慧、迴向一切智為二，智慧性即是迴向一切智性，於其中入一相者，是為入不二法門。」

Inexhaustible Mind Bodhisattva (Akṣayamati) said, “*Dāna* (giving) and the transference to omniscience (*sarvajñānapariṇāmanā*) make a duality. The nature of *dāna* is the transference to omniscience. Like this, *śīla*, *kṣānti*, *virya*, *dhyāna, prajñā*, and the transference to omniscience make dualities. The nature of *prajñā* is the nature of the transference to omniscience, and to enter the singleness of these is to enter the Dharma Door on Nonduality.” ** ****

深慧菩薩曰：「是空、是無相、是無作為二。空即無相，無相即無作；若空、無相、無作，則無心意識。於一解脫門即是三解脫門者，是為入不二法門。」

Profound Wisdom Bodhisattva (Gambhinīrmati) said, “Emptiness (*śūnyatā*), characteristiclessness (*ānamitta*), and desirelessness (*apraṇihita*) make dualities. Emptiness is without characteristics and that which is without characteristics is undesirable. If empty, characteristicless, and desireless, then there is no mind (*citta*), thought (*mānas*) or consciousness (*vijñāna*). That the three doors of liberation are a single door of liberation is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

寂根菩薩曰：「佛、法、眾為二。佛即是法，法即是眾，是三寶皆無為相，與虛空等，一切法亦爾。能隨此行者，是為入不二法門。」

Tranquil Roots Bodhisattva (Śāntendriya) said, “Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha make dualities. The Buddha is the Dharma, and the Dharma is the Sangha. These three jewels are without the characteristic of being conditioned, as equal as space, as are all *dharmas*. Being able to follow this practice is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

心無礙菩薩曰：「身、身滅為二。身即是身滅。所以者何？見身實相者，不起見身及見滅身，身與滅身無二無分別，於其中不驚、不懼者，是為入不二法門。」

Mind Unobstructed Bodhisattva (Apratihatanetra) said, “The body and the body’s extinction make a duality. The body is the body’s extinction. How so? One who sees the Real Nature of the body, not giving rise to seeing a body or seeing the extinction of the body. The body and the extinction of the body not as two, without differentiation. Being unalarmed in between them, being unafraid is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

上善菩薩曰：「身、口、意善為二。是三業皆無作相，身無作相，即口無作相；口無作相，即意無作相；是三業無作相，即一切法無作相。能如是隨無作慧者，是為入不二法門。」

Superior Virtue Bodhisattva (Suvinīta) said, “Virtues of body, speech, and mind make dualities. These three karmic actions are without the characteristic of being enacted (*anabhisaṃskāra-lakṣana*). The body is without the characteristic of being enacted, so the mouth is without the characteristic of being enacted. As the mouth is without the characteristic of being enacted, so the mind is without the characteristic of being enacted. These three karmic actions being without the characteristic of being enacted, then *dharmas* are without the characteristic of being enacted. Being able to follow unenacted wisdom like this is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

福田菩薩曰：「福行、罪行、不動行為二。三行實性即是空，空則無福行、無罪行、無不動行。於此三行而不起者，是為入不二法門。」

Field of Merit Bodhisattva (Puṇyakṣetra) said, “Meritorious acts, transgressive acts, and unmoving acts make dualities. The Real Nature of these three acts is emptiness, and emptiness is without meritorious action, without transgressive action, and without unmoving actions. Being in the non-arising of these three actions is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

華嚴菩薩曰：「從我起二為二。見我實相者，不起二法；若不住二法，則無有識。無所識者，是為入不二法門。」

Flower Arrangement Bodhisattva (Padmavyūha) said, “The arising of two (duality) from self makes a duality. One who sees the Real Characteristic of the self does not give rise to there being two things (*dharmas*). If there is no abiding in two things, then there is no consciousness [of anything]. Being without there being consciousness is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

德藏菩薩曰：「有所得相為二。若無所得，則無取捨。無取捨者，是為入不二法門。」

Treasury of Virtue Bodhisattva (Śrīgarbha) said, “The characteristic that there is something to attain something makes a duality. If there is nothing to attain, then there is nothing to grasp or let go of. Being without grasping and letting go is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality,”

月上菩薩曰：「闇與明為二。無闇、無明，則無有二。所以者何？如入滅受想定，無闇、無明，一切法相亦復如是，於其中平等入者，是為入不二法門。」

Moon in Midair Bodhisattva (Candrottara) said, “Darkness along with illumination make a duality. Being without darkness and without illumination, then there are not two. How so? Like entering a meditation where there is the cessation of sensation and perception (*nirodhasamāpatti*), which is without darkness and without illumination, the characteristics of all *dharmas* are also like this. Entering the equality (*samatā*) of these is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

寶印手菩薩曰：「樂涅槃、不樂世間為二。若不樂涅槃、不厭世間，則無有二。所以者何？若有縛，則有解。若本無縛，其誰求解？無縛無解，則無樂厭，是為入不二法門。」

Jewel Mudra Hand Bodhisattva (Ratnamudrāhasta) said, “To delight in Nirvana and not delight in the world make a duality. If one does not delight in Nirvana and does not have disgust for the world, then there are not two. How so? If there is bondage, then there is liberation. If originally there is no bondage, then who is there to seek liberation? Being without bondage and without liberation, thus without delight or disgust, is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

珠頂王菩薩曰：「正道、邪道為二。住正道者，則不分別是邪是正，離此二者，是為入不二法門。」

Jewel Crown King Bodhisattva (Mānikuṭārāja) said, “The Right Way and the wrong way make a duality. One who abides in the Right Way does not differentiate between what is wrong and right. Transcending these two is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

樂實菩薩曰：「實、不實為二。實見者尚不見實，何況非實！所以者何？非肉眼所見，慧眼乃能見，而此慧眼，無見無不見，是為入不二法門。」

Delight in Reality Bodhisattva (Satyarata) said, “Real (*satya*) and not real make a duality. One who really sees does not even see what is reality, how much more so what is not reality? How so? The Eye of Wisdom sees what the eye of flesh cannot, and this Eye of Wisdom that is without seeing and without not seeing is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

如是諸菩薩各各說已，問文殊師利：「何等是菩薩入不二法門？」

When all the bodhisattvas had each explained like this they asked Mañjuśrī, “How does the bodhisattva enter the Dharma Door of Nonduality?”

文殊師利曰：「如我意者，於一切法無言無說，無示無識，離諸問答，是為入不二法門。」

Mañjuśrī said, “As I understand it, being without words and without explanation, without indication and without consciousness, transcending all questions and answers is entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

於是文殊師利問維摩詰：「我等各自說已，仁者當說何等是菩薩入不二法門？」

At this, Mañjuśrī asked Vimalakīrti, “We have each now explained. Will the venerable now explain how this bodhisattva enter the Dharma Door of Nonduality?” **

時維摩詰默然無言。

Vimalakīrti was silent, remaining speechless.

文殊師利歎曰：「善哉！善哉！乃至無有文字、語言，是真入不二法門。」

Mañjuśrī sighed and said, “Excellent! Excellent! Not even a word, not a syllable is truly entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality.”

說是入不二法門品時，於此眾中，五千菩薩皆入不二法門，得無生法忍。

When this chapter on entering the Dharma Door of Nonduality was explained, five thousand bodhisattvas among those assembled all entered the Dharma Door of Nonduality and attained the patient tolerance of the non-arising of dharmas.
## CHAPTER TEN - *ACCUMULATION OF FRAGRANCES BUDDHA*

香積佛品第十
Chapter Ten: Accumulation of Fragrances Buddha

於是舍利弗心念：「日時欲至，此諸菩薩當於何食？」

THen, Śāriputra thought to himself, “It is almost noon. What will all these bodhisattvas eat?”

時維摩詰知其意而語言：「佛說八解脫，仁者受行，豈雜欲食而聞法乎？若欲食者，且待須臾，當令汝得未曾有食。」

Then Vimalakīrti, knowing his thoughts, said, “The Buddha has explained the eight emancipations, and the Venerable has accepted their practice. How can you mix up the desire for food and the desire for listening to the Dharma? If you want to eat, just wait a moment and you will be provided with an unprecedented meal.”

時維摩詰即入三昧，以神通力示諸大眾，上方界分過四十二恒河沙佛土，有國名眾香，佛號香積，今現在，其國香氣，比於十方諸佛世界人、天之香，最為第一。彼土無有聲聞、辟支佛名，唯有清淨大菩薩眾，佛為說法。其界一切，皆以香作樓閣，經行香地，苑園皆香，其食香氣，周流十方無量世界。時彼佛與諸菩薩方共坐食，有諸天子皆號香嚴，悉發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，供養彼佛及諸菩薩，此諸大眾莫不目見。

Then Vimalakīrti entered samadhi, and by the power of spiritual penetration, manifested to the great gathering that, in the upper direction past buddha lands as numerous as the sands of forty-two Ganges Rivers, there is a land called Gathered Fragrances, with a buddha named
Accumulation of Fragrances, who currently exists in that world. In comparison with the world-systems of the other buddhas throughout the ten directions, the fragrances experienced by the humans and gods of that country are supreme. In that land, the names ‘voice hearer’ (*śrāvaka*) and ‘solitary buddha’ (*pratyekabuddha*) do not exist—there is only the great gathering of pure bodhisattvas, for whom the Buddha explains the Dharma. In that world, all the buildings are made of fragrances. In doing walking meditation on that fragrant earth, the gardens are all fragrant. The fragrance of the food there circulates throughout the immeasurable worlds in the ten directions. When that Buddha and all the bodhisattvas sit together to eat, the gods in attendance all exclaim ornamental fragrances and all generate *anuttarā samyak-saṃbodhi citta* and make offerings to that buddha and the bodhisattvas. Everyone in the great gathering witnessed what they had never seen before.

時維摩詰問眾菩薩言：「諸仁者！誰能致彼佛飯？」以文殊師利威神力故，咸皆默然。維摩詰言：「仁此大眾，無乃可恥？」

Then Vimalakīrti asked all the bodhisattvas, “Venerables! Who is able to go get food from that buddha?” But, due to the influence of Mañjuśrī’s spiritual power, they all remained silent. Vimalakīrti said, “Venerable, this great assembly, is it not shameful?”

文殊師利曰：「如佛所言，勿輕未學。」

Mañjuśrī replied, “As the Buddha has said, one should not put down those who have not learned.”

於是維摩詰不起于座，居眾會前，化作菩薩，相好光明，威德殊勝，蔽於眾會，而告之曰：「汝往上方界分，度如四十二恒河沙佛土，有國名眾香，佛號香積，與諸菩薩方共坐食。汝往到彼，如我辭曰：『維摩詰稽首世尊足下！致敬無量，問訊起居，少病少惱，氣力安不？願得世尊所食之餘，當於娑婆世界施作佛事，令此樂小法者得弘大道，亦使如來名聲普聞。』」

At this Vimalakīrti, without rising from his seat, in front of everyone gathered in his house, created a bodhisattva by transformation with radiant auspicious characteristics and a glorious presence that surpassed everyone in the assembly and he told it, “Go to the world in the upper direction where, separated from here by buddha lands as numerous as the sands of forty-two Ganges Rivers, there is a land called Gathered Fragrances. The buddha [there] is named Accumulation of Fragrances. Along with all the bodhisattvas, they are just now sitting down to eat. Go there, and say as I tell you: ‘Vimalakīrti bows his head to the feet of the World-Honored One! With great respect he inquires immeasurable times, are your ills slight, some slight vexation, and whether your energies are at peace? He wishes to obtain the leftovers of the World-Honored One’s meal, which would be given to accomplish the Buddha’s work in the Sahā world. It will cause those who delight in lesser dharmas to disseminate the great path, and it will also cause the name of the Thus Come One to be universally heard.’”

時化菩薩即於會前，昇于上方，舉眾皆見其去，到眾香界，禮彼佛足，又聞其言：「維摩詰稽首世尊足下！致敬無量，問訊起居，少病少惱，氣力安不？願得世尊所食之餘，欲於娑婆世界施作佛事，使此樂小法者得弘大道，亦使如來名聲普聞。」

Then the transformation bodhisattva, in front of the assembly, ascended to the upper direction and the entire congregation saw him arrive at that Gathered Fragrances world-system and worship at that Buddha’s feet, and they also heard him say, “Vimalakīrti bows his head to the feet of the World-honored One, and with great respect he inquires immeasurable times, Are your ills slight, some slight vexation, and whether your energies are at peace? He wishes to obtain the leftovers of the World-Honored One’s meal, which would be given to accomplish the Buddha’s work in the Sahā world. It will cause those who delight in ‘lesser dharmas’ to disseminate the great path, and it will also cause the name of the Thus Come One to be universally heard.”

彼諸大士見化菩薩，歎未曾有：「今此上人從何所來？娑婆世界為在何許？云何名為樂小法者？」即以問佛。佛告之曰：「下方度如四十二恒河沙佛土，有世界名娑婆，佛號釋迦牟尼，今現在。於五濁惡世，為樂小法眾生敷演道教；彼有菩薩名維摩詰，住不可思議解脫，為諸菩薩說法，故遣化來，稱揚我名，并讚此土，令彼菩薩增益功德。」

When the great beings there saw the transformation bodhisattva, they exclaimed that it was unprecedented. “Where has this superior person come from? Where is the Sahā world? What does ‘those who delight in lesser dharmas’ mean?” So they asked the Buddha. The Buddha told them, “In the lower direction, separated from here by buddha lands as numerous as the sands of forty-two Ganges Rivers, is a world named Sahā. The buddha there is named Śākyamuni, who exists at present. In an evil time of five *kaṣāya* (stages of corruption), he broadly expounds the teaching of the path in order to enlighten those who delight in lesser dharmas. One of his bodhisattvas is named Vimalakīrti, who resides in the Inconceivable Liberation and explains the Dharma for  bodhisattvas. Therefore, he has sent this transformation here to praise my name and extol this land, so that those bodhisattvas will increase their merit.”

彼菩薩言：「其人何如，乃作是化？德力無畏，神足若斯！」佛言：「甚大！一切十方皆遣化往，施作佛事，饒益眾生。」

Those bodhisattvas said, “Who is this person and how did they make this transformation? How great must his merit power, fearlessness, and spiritual powers be!”

The Buddha said, “Extremely great! He sends transformations throughout the ten directions, where they carry out the Buddha’s work and benefit sentient beings.”

於是香積如來以眾香鉢盛滿香飯，與化菩薩。時彼九百萬菩薩俱發聲言：「我欲詣娑婆世界供養釋迦牟尼佛，并欲見維摩詰等諸菩薩眾。」佛言：「可往。攝汝身香，無令彼諸眾生起惑著心。又當捨汝本形，勿使彼國求菩薩者，而自鄙恥。又汝於彼莫懷輕賤，而作礙想。所以者何？十方國土，皆如虛空。又諸佛為欲化諸樂小法者，不盡現其清淨土耳！」時化菩薩既受鉢飯，與彼九百萬菩薩俱，承佛威神，及維摩詰力，於彼世界，忽然不現，須臾之間，至維摩詰舍。

At this, Accumulation of Fragrances Thus Come One shared a bowl full of gathered fragrances and fragrant food with the transformation bodhisattva. Then nine million bodhisattvas there together raised their voices saying, “We wish to go to the Sahā World to make offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha. And we wish to see Vimalakīrti and all the other bodhisattvas. The Buddha said, “You can go, but withdraw the fragrances of your bodies, so as not to cause the sentient beings there to generate thoughts of deluded attachment. Also, you should relinquish your original forms, so as not to cause those bodhisattva seekers in that country to be ashamed of themselves. Also, you must not harbor feelings of belittlement or disgust, and create hindered perceptions. Why? All lands throughout the Ten Directions are all like empty space. Also, all buddhas do not completely manifest their pure lands because they want to transform those who delight in lesser dharma!” Then the transformation bodhisattva received the bowl of food and, with those nine million bodhisattvas, by means of the Buddha’s awesome spiritual [powers] and Vimalakīrti’s power, they  suddenly disappeared from that world and, in an instant, they arrived at Vimalakīrti’s house.

時維摩詰即化作九百萬師子之座，嚴好如前，諸菩薩皆坐其上。是化菩薩以滿鉢香飯與維摩詰，飯香普熏毘耶離城，及三千大千世界。時毘耶離婆羅門、居士等，聞是香氣，身意快然，歎未曾有！於是長者主月蓋從八萬四千人，來入維摩詰舍。見其室中菩薩甚多，諸師子座，高廣嚴好，皆大歡喜，禮眾菩薩及大弟子，却住一面。諸地神、虛空神及欲、色界諸天，聞此香氣，亦皆來入維摩詰舍。

Then Vimalakīrti created by transformation nine million lion seats, excellently ornamented as before, and the bodhisattvas all sat upon them. When the transformation bodhisattva gave the bowl full of fragrant food to Vimalakīrti, the fragrance of the food permeated the city of Vaiśālī and the entire Three Thousand Great Thousand world-system. Then the Brāhmans and retired scholars of Vaiśālī smelled this fragrance and their bodies and minds were joyful, and they sighed at the unprecedented. At this, a chief of the elders, Moon Canopy, followed by eighty-four thousand people, came and entered Vimalakīrti’s house. Seeing so many bodhisattvas inside the room, and all the lion seats, so tall and so broad, with the finest ornamentation, they were all great joyful and revered the gathering of bodhisattvas and great disciples, then stood to one side. [And] all the earth spirits, sky [or space] spirits, and gods of the realms of desire and form smelled this fragrance, also coming and entering Vimalakīrti’s house.

時維摩詰語舍利弗等諸大聲聞：「仁者可食，如來甘露味飯，大悲所熏，無以限意食之，使不消也。」有異聲聞念：「是飯少，而此大眾人人當食？」化菩薩曰：「勿以聲聞小德小智，稱量如來無量福慧！四海有竭，此飯無盡！使一切人食，揣若須彌，乃至一劫，猶不能盡。所以者何？無盡戒、定、智慧、解脫、解脫知見功德具足者，所食之餘，終不可盡。」於是鉢飯悉飽眾會，猶故不[歹*斯]。其諸菩薩、聲聞、天、人，食此飯者，身安快樂，譬如一切樂莊嚴國諸菩薩也；又諸毛孔皆出妙香，亦如眾香國土諸樹之香。

Then Vimalakīrti said to Śāriputra and the other great voice hearers, “Venerables, you may eat this  food of the flavor of sweet dew of the Thus Come One, which is perfumed with the limitless intention of great compassion, and which will not be diminished by its consumption.”

A different voice hearer thought, “There is not much food, yet everyone in this great assembly is supposed to eat!”

The transformation bodhisattva said, “Do not measure the limitless blessings and sagacity of the Thus Come One with the small merit and small wisdom of a voice hearer! Even were the four seas to dry up, this food would not be exhausted. Even if everyone ate as much as Sumeru for an entire *kalpa*, we would never be able to exhaust it. Why? That which is left over from the meal of someone who fully possesses the merits of morality, concentration, wisdom, liberation, and the vision and hearing of emancipation can never be exhausted.”

Then the food in the bowl was used to satisfy the gathered assembly, yet it remained just as it was, without depletion. All the bodhisattvas, voice hearers, gods and humans eating the food had a sense of bodily ease and delight of mind, just as every bodhisattva delights in adorning lands, and a wonderful scent also emitted from the hair pores of their bodies, like the scents of all the trees of Land of Gathered Fragrances.”

爾時維摩詰問眾香菩薩：「香積如來以何說法？」

Then Vimalakīrti asked the Gathered Fragrances bodhisattvas, “How does Accumulation of Fragrances Thus Come One explain the Dharma?”

彼菩薩曰：「我土如來無文字說，但以眾香令諸天、人得入律行。菩薩各各坐香樹下，聞斯妙香，即獲一切德藏三昧。得是三昧者，菩薩所有功德皆悉具足。」

Those bodhisattvas replied, “The Thus Come One of our land does not explain with words and letters, simply by using gathered fragrances do all gods and humans enter disciplined practice. Bodhisattvas each sit beneath a fragrant tree and smell such wondrous fragrances that they ‘catch’ (attain) all the virtuous treasuries of *samādhi*. Those who attain this *samādhi* all become replete in the merits of a bodhisattva.”

彼諸菩薩問維摩詰：「今世尊釋迦牟尼以何說法？」

All those bodhisattvas then asked Vimalakīrti, “How does the World-Honored One Śākyamuni explain the Dharma here?”

維摩詰言：「此土眾生剛強難化，故佛為說剛強之語以調伏之。言是地獄、是畜生、是餓鬼，是諸難處，是愚人生處；是身邪行，是身邪行報；是口邪行，是口邪行報；是意邪行，是意邪行報；是殺生，是殺生報；是不與取，是不與取報；是邪婬，是邪婬報；是妄語，是妄語報；是兩舌，是兩舌報；是惡口，是惡口報；是無義語，是無義語報；是貪嫉，是貪嫉報；是瞋惱，是瞋惱報；是邪見，是邪見報；是慳悋，是慳悋報；是毀戒，是毀戒報；是瞋恚，是瞋恚報；是懈怠，是懈怠報；是亂意，是亂意報；是愚癡，是愚癡報；是結戒，是持戒，是犯戒；是應作，是不應作；是障礙，是不障礙；是得罪，是離罪；是淨，是垢；是有漏，是無漏；是邪道，是正道；是有為，是無為；是世間，是涅槃。以難化之人，心如猨猴，故以若干種法，制御其心，乃可調伏。譬如象馬，[怡-台+龍]悷不調，加諸楚毒，乃至徹骨，然後調伏。如是剛強難化眾生，故以一切苦切之言，乃可入律。」

Vimalakīrti said, “The sentient beings of this land are obdurate and difficult to convert, and so the Buddha disciplines them by means of stern language. He says, ‘There are the hells, there are animals, and there are hungry ghosts. These are the places of difficulty, and these are the places
where the foolish are born. These are improper practices of the body, and these are the retributions for improper practices of the body. These are improper practices of the mouth, and these are the retributions for improper practices of the mouth. These are improper practices of the mind, and these are the retributions for improper practices of the mind. This is to kill sentient beings, and this is the retribution for killing sentient beings. This is to take what is not given, and this is the retribution for taking what is not given. This is improper behavior, and this is the retribution for
improper behavior. This is false speech, and this is the retribution for false speech. This is slander, and this is the retribution for slander. This is defamation, and this is the retribution for defamation. This is idle speech, and this is the retribution for idle speech. These are desire and jealousy, and this is the retribution for desire and jealousy. These are anger and vexation, and this is the retribution for anger and vexation. These are heterodox views, and this is the retribution for heterodox views. This is parsimony, and this is the retribution for parsimony. This is breaking the precepts, and this is the retribution for breaking the precepts. This is anger, and this is the retribution for anger. This is
laziness, and this is the retribution for laziness. This is perturbation, and this is the retribution for perturbation. This is stupidity, and this is the retribution for stupidity. This is to be bound by the precepts, this is to maintain the precepts, and this is to transgress the precepts. This is what you should do, and this is what you should not do. These are hindrances, and these are not hindrances.
These are transgressions, and these are not transgressions. This is pure, and this is defiled. This is to have flaws, and this is to be flawless. This is the wrong path, and this is the correct path. This is the conditioned, and this is the unconditioned. This is worldly, and this is Nirvana.’”

“Since the minds of people so difficult to convert are like monkeys, one must use several types of Dharma to control their minds, so that they can be disciplined. It is like elephants and horses who are stubborn and uncontrollable, who can only be disciplined by making them suffer to the bone. Because sentient beings are obdurate like this, [The Buddha] uses all sorts of strict language to get [sentient beings] to enter disciplined practice.”

彼諸菩薩聞說是已，皆曰：「未曾有也！如世尊釋迦牟尼佛，隱其無量自在之力，乃以貧所樂法，度脫眾生；斯諸菩薩亦能勞謙，以無量大悲，生是佛土。」

When those bodhisattvas heard this explanation, they all said, “Unprecedented! Thus the World-honored One Śākyamuni Buddha conceals his immeasurable autonomous powers and uses that which is enjoyed by the poverty-stricken to free sentient beings. The bodhisattvas here are also able to labor and be humble, and it is with immeasurable great compassion that they have been born in this Buddha Land.”

維摩詰言：「此土菩薩於諸眾生大悲堅固，誠如所言。然其一世饒益眾生，多於彼國百千劫行。所以者何？此娑婆世界有十事善法，諸餘淨土之所無有。何等為十？以布施攝貧窮，以淨戒攝毀禁，以忍辱攝瞋恚，以精進攝懈怠，以禪定攝亂意，以智慧攝愚癡，說除難法度八難者，以大乘法度樂小乘者，以諸善根濟無德者，常以四攝成就眾生，是為十。」

Vimalakīrti said, “The bodhisattvas of this land are resolute in their compassion for all sentient beings. Truly, it is as you have said. Thus in a single lifetime they benefit more sentient beings than you do in that country in a hundred thousand *kalpas* of practice. Why? This Sahā world has ten excellent *dharmas* (things about them) that are lacking in the other pure lands. What are these ten?1. The poor are attracted by Giving; 2. transgressors are attracted by pure Precepts; 3. the angry are attracted by Patience; 4. the lazy are attracted by Determination; 5. the crazed are attracted by meditation; 6. the foolish are attracted by Wisdom; 7. those who experience the eight difficulties are liberated by explanation of the Dharma on eliminating difficulties; 8. those who delight in the Hinayana are liberated by the Mahayana; 9. those without virtue are ‘ferried’ by all good roots; and 10. all sentient beings are liberated by the Four Means of ‘Attraction’ (inclusion). These are the ten.”

彼菩薩曰：「菩薩成就幾法？於此世界行無瘡疣，生于淨土。」

Those bodhisattvas said, “How many *dharmas* do bodhisattvas accomplish in their flawless practice in this world to be born in[to] a pure land?”

維摩詰言：「菩薩成就八法，於此世界行無瘡疣，生于淨土。何等為八？饒益眾生，而不望報；代一切眾生受諸苦惱，所作功德盡以施之；等心眾生，謙下無礙；於諸菩薩視之如佛；所未聞經，聞之不疑；不與聲聞而相違背；不嫉彼供，不高己利，而於其中調伏其心；常省己過，不訟彼短，恒以一心求諸功德，是為八法。」

Vimalakīrti said, “Bodhisattvas accomplish eight dharmas in their flawless practice in this world to be born in[to] a pure land. What are the eight? 1. They benefit sentient beings without seeking anything in return; 2. they take upon themselves the sufferings of all living beings, and what merit they acquire thereby is given to those beings; 3. they are even-minded toward all sentient beings, humble and non-contrarian; 4. they see bodhisattvas as if they are buddhas; 5. they hear and do not doubt sutras they have not heard before; 6. they do not dispute voice hearers; 7. they do not envy the alms received by others, nor boast of their own gains, and, in all of this, their minds are disciplined; 8. they always reflect on their own errors and do not point out the shortcomings of others, they just single mindedly seek all virtues. These are the eight.

維摩詰、文殊師利於大眾中說是法時，百千天、人皆發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，十千菩薩得無生法忍。

When Vimalakīrti and Mañjuśrī explained this Dharma to the great congregation, a hundred thousand gods and humans all generated ***anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi citta***, and ten thousand bodhisattvas attained the patient tolerance of the birthlessness of *dharmas*.
## CHAPTER ELEVEN - *PRACTICES OF THE BODHISATTVA*

菩薩行品第十一
Chapter Eleven: Practices of the Bodhisattva

是時佛說法於菴羅樹園，其地忽然廣博嚴事，一切眾會皆作金色。阿難白佛言：「世尊！以何因緣，有此瑞應？是處忽然廣博嚴事，一切眾會皆作金色。」

At that time, the Buddha was in the Āmrapālī Garden explaining the Dharma, when the ground suddenly became broad and beautifully adorned, and everyone in the assembly all became the color of gold. Ānanda asked the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! What are the ‘causes and conditions’ of these auspicious signs? The ground suddenly becoming broad and beautifully adorned, and everyone in the assembly all becoming the color of gold.”

佛告阿難：「是維摩詰、文殊師利，與諸大眾恭敬圍繞，發意欲來，故先為此瑞應。」

The Buddha told Ānanda, “Vimalakīrti, Mañjuśrī*,* along with a great assembly that surrounds and honors them, are generating thoughts wishing to come [here], and so there first appears these auspicious signs.”

於是維摩詰語文殊師利：「可共見佛，與諸菩薩禮事供養。」

At this, Vimalakīrti said to Mañjuśrī*, “*We should go together to see the Buddha and, along with all the bodhisattvas, to worship and make offerings.”

文殊師利言：「善哉！行矣！今正是時。」

Mañjuśrī replied, “Excellent! Let’s go! Now is the time.”

維摩詰即以神力，持諸大眾并師子座，置於右掌，往詣佛所。到已著地，稽首佛足，右遶七匝，一心合掌，在一面立；其諸菩薩即皆避座，稽首佛足，亦繞七匝，於一面立；諸大弟子、釋、梵、四天王等，亦皆避座，稽首佛足，在一面立。

Vimalakīrti then used his spiritual powers to hold the entire great congregation along with their lion throne seats in his right hand and proceeded to where the Buddha was. Upon arriving, he placed them on the ground, bowed his head to the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him seven times to the right and, holding his palms together single-mindedly, stood to one side. The bodhisattvas all got up from their seats and bowed their heads to the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him seven times, and stood to one side. The great disciples, Śakras, Brahmās, four heavenly kings, and so on, also all got up from their seats, bowed their heads to the Buddha’s feet, and stood to one side.”

於是世尊如法慰問諸菩薩已，各令復坐，即皆受教。眾坐已定，佛語舍利弗：「汝見菩薩大士，自在神力之所為乎？」

Then the World-honored One, according to dharmic custom, requested that the bodhisattvas all sit once again, and they all followed these instructions. When the congregation was seated they entered concentration, and the Buddha said to Śāriputra, “Have you seen what this bodhisattva,
this great being, can do with his sovereign spiritual power?”

「唯然，已見！」

“Yes, I have seen!”

「於汝意云何？」「世尊！我覩其為不可思議，非意所圖，非度所測。」

“What do you think of it?”

“World-honored One, I see what has been done as inconceivable, not something the mind can chart, beyond estimation.”

爾時阿難白佛言：「世尊！今所聞香，自昔未有，是為何香？」

At that time, Ānanda addressed the Buddha saying, “World-honored One! This fragrance
I now smell, I have never experienced it before. What fragrance is it?”

佛告阿難：「是彼菩薩毛孔之香。」

The Buddha told Ānanda, “It is the fragrance of these bodhisattvas’ hair pores.”

於是舍利弗語阿難言：「我等毛孔亦出是香。」

At this, Śāriputra said to Ānanda, “Our hair pores also emit this fragrance.”

阿難言：「此所從來？」

Ānanda said, “Where does it come from?”

曰：「是長者維摩詰，從眾香國，取佛餘飯，於舍食者，一切毛孔皆香若此。」

[Śāriputra] replied, “This elder, Vimalakīrti, brought the leftover meal from the buddha of the Land of Gathered Fragrances to his house to eat, and so all our hair pores are fragrant like this.”

阿難問維摩詰：「是香氣住當久如？」

Ānanda inquired of Vimalakīrti saying, “How long will this fragrance last?”

維摩詰言：「至此飯消。」

Vimalakīrti  replied, “Until the food is digested.”

曰：「此飯久如當消？」

[Ānanda] replied, “How long does this food take to digest?”

曰：「此飯勢力至于七日，然後乃消。又阿難！若聲聞人未入正位，食此飯者，得入正位，然後乃消；已入正位，食此飯者，得心解脫，然後乃消；若未發大乘意，食此飯者，至發意乃消；已發意食此飯者，得無生忍，然後乃消；已得無生忍，食此飯者，至一生補處，然後乃消。譬如有藥，名曰上味，其有服者，身諸毒滅，然後乃消。此飯如是，滅除一切諸煩惱毒，然後乃消。」

[Vimalakīrti] replied, “The vitality of this food remains for seven days, after which it is digested. Furthermore, Ānanda! If voice hearers who have not yet entered correct establishment eat this food, it will only be digested after they enter correct establishment. If they have already entered correct establishment and they eat this food, it will only be digested after the mind is liberated. If those who have not generated the thought of the Great Vehicle eat this food, it will only be digested after they arrived at generating this thought. If they have already generated the thought and they eat this food, it will only be digested after they have attained the patient tolerance of the birthlessness of all dharmas. If they have already attained the patient tolerance for the birthlessness of all dharmas and they eat this food, it will only be digested after they have arrived at the station of those who have only one more rebirth. It is just like the medicine called Superior Flavor. It is with the one who eats it as the body eliminates all poisons, after which it is digested. This food is like this, eliminating all the poisonous afflictions, after which it is digested.”

阿難白佛言：「未曾有也，世尊！如此香飯能作佛事。」

Ānanda addressed the Buddha saying, “Unprecedented, World-Honored One! Scented food like this, capable of performing the work of the Buddha.”

佛言：「如是，如是！阿難！或有佛土以佛光明而作佛事，有以諸菩薩而作佛事，有以佛所化人而作佛事，有以菩提樹而作佛事，有以佛衣服、臥具而作佛事，有以飯食而作佛事，有以園林臺觀而作佛事，有以三十二相、八十隨形好而作佛事，有以佛身而作佛事，有以虛空而作佛事；眾生應以此緣得入律行。有以夢、幻、影、響、鏡中像、水中月、熱時炎，如是等喻而作佛事。有以音聲、語言、文字而作佛事。或有清淨佛土、寂寞無言、無說、無示、無識、無作、無為，而作佛事。如是，阿難！諸佛威儀進止，諸所施為，無非佛事。

The Buddha replied, “So it is, so it is! Ānanda! There are buddha lands where the light of the Buddha performs the work of the Buddha, or where bodhisattvas perform the work of the Buddha, or where transformational people created by the Buddha perform the work of the Buddha, or where the Bodhi Tree performs the work of the Buddha, or where the Buddha’s clothing and bedding perform the work of the Buddha, or where food performs the work of the Buddha, or where groves and pavilions perform the Buddha’s work, or where the thirty-two characteristics and eighty subsidiary signs perform the work of the Buddha, or where the Buddha’s body performs the work of the Buddha, or where space performs the work of the Buddha, [wherever it is], sentient beings respond to these conditions and attain entry into the practice of the Discipline. There are those where dreams, illusions, shadows, echoes, images in a mirror, the moon in [the surfaces of] waters, mirages in the heat, and other such analogies as these perform the work of the Buddha. There are those sounds, speech, and writing that perform the work of the Buddha. Or there are those pure Buddha Lands, tranquil and without words, without speech, without demonstration, without consciousness, without doing, without effort [conditioning, *wu-wei*], yet performing the work of the Buddha. Thus, Ānanda! All Buddhas, in their respect-inspiring deportment, drive, and composure, with everything they give, there is nothing that is not the work of the Buddha.”

「阿難！有此四魔，八萬四千諸煩惱門，而諸眾生為之疲勞，諸佛即以此法而作佛事，是名入一切諸佛法門。菩薩入此門者，若見一切淨好佛土，不以為喜，不貪不高；若見一切不淨佛土，不以為憂，不礙不沒；但於諸佛生清淨心，歡喜恭敬，未曾有也！諸佛如來功德平等！為化眾生故，而現佛土不同。阿難！汝見諸佛國土，地有若干，而虛空無若干也；如是見諸佛色身有若干耳，其無礙慧無若干也。

“Ānanda! There are these four Maras and eighty-four thousand gateways to all the afflictions that cause all sentient beings to be wearied and troubled. All Buddha’s use these things to perform the work of a Buddha. This is called entering the gateway of everything being Buddha Dharma. Bodhisattvas who enter this gateway, if they see all the pure, wonderous Buddha Lands, they do not feel joy, or want, or elation (’high’). If they see all the impure Buddha Lands, they do not feel grief, or obstruction, or depression (’low’). They just give rise to a pure mind toward all Buddhas, joyfully reverent, like never before! This is the equanimity of the merit of all Buddha, Thus Come Ones! In order to transform sentient beings they manifest different Buddha Lands. Ānanda! Look at the lands of all the buddha countries, the ground has differences but space is without any difference. Like this, see all the bodies of form of the buddhas as having their differences, while their unobstructed wisdom is without any difference.”

「阿難！諸佛色身、威相、種性，戒、定、智慧、解脫、解脫知見，力、無所畏、不共之法、大慈、大悲，威儀所行，及其壽命，說法教化，成就眾生，淨佛國土，具諸佛法，悉皆同等，是故名為三藐三佛陀，名為多陀阿伽度，名為佛陀。阿難！若我廣說此三句義，汝以劫壽，不能盡受；正使三千大千世界滿中眾生，皆如阿難多聞第一，得念總持，此諸人等，以劫之壽，亦不能受。如是，阿難！諸佛阿耨多羅三藐三菩提，無有限量，智慧辯才不可思議。」

“Ānanda! All the buddhas’ bodies of form, their glorious characteristics, various natures, discipline, concentrations, wisdom, liberations, liberated knowledge and vision, powers, fearlessnesses, unique qualities, great kindness, great compassion, practices of proper deportment, and their life-spans, Dharma they explain to teach and transform, maturing sentient beings, purification of buddha lands and completion of all Buddha Dharma, are all completely, totally equal (*sama*) therefore they are known as ***Sam-yak-saṃ-bud-dha***, known as ***Ta-th-ā-ga-ta***, known as **Bud-dha**. Ananda! If I fully explained the meaning of these three words, even if you lived as long as a *kalpa*, I would still be unable to exhaustively tell you. Even if all the sentient beings in a Three Thousand Great Thousand world-system were just like Ānanda - foremost (’number one’) in hearing (learning), having attained retentive mindfulness (*dhāraṇī*) - and these people all had life-spans also a *kalpa* long, I would be unable to tell them. Thus, Ānanda! The *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi* of all buddhas is without limit or measure, their wisdom and eloquence cannot be conceived.

阿難白佛言：「我從今已往，不敢自謂以為多聞。」

Ānanda addressed the Buddha saying, “From now on, I will not regard myself as someone who has ‘heard’ (learned) much.”

佛告阿難：「勿起退意！所以者何？我說汝於聲聞中為最多聞，非謂菩薩。且止，阿難！其有智者不應限度諸菩薩也；一切海淵尚可測量，菩薩禪定、智慧、總持、辯才一切功德不可量也。阿難！汝等捨置菩薩所行，是維摩詰一時所現神通之力。一切聲聞、辟支佛於百千劫，盡力變化所不能作。」

The Buddha told Ānanda, “Do not be discouraged! Why? I have said that you are the highest, most learned among *śrāvakas*, not among bodhisattvas. But stop, Ānanda! One who has wisdom should not evaluate the bodhisattvas, for the depths of an ocean may be measured, [but] the bodhisattvas *dhyana*, *prajñā, dhāraṇīs*, eloquence and all their virtues cannot be measured. Ānanda! You [*śrāvakas*] have forsaken the practices of bodhisattvas. The manifestation of mystical powers by Vimalakīrti this one time, all the *śrāvakas* and *pratyekabuddhas* would be unable to do in hundreds of thousands of kalpas with all their powers of extinguishment and transformation.”

爾時眾香世界菩薩來者，合掌白佛言：「世尊！我等初見此土，生下劣想，今自悔責，捨離是心。所以者何？諸佛方便，不可思議！為度眾生故，隨其所應，現佛國異。唯然世尊！願賜少法，還於彼土，當念如來。」

At that time, the bodhisattvas from the world-system Gathered Fragrances joined their palms and addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! When we first saw this land, we perceived it as being inferior. Now we feel ashamed of ourselves and let go of this way of thinking. How so? The *upāya* of all buddhas is inconceivable! In order to liberate sentient beings, in accordance with their inclinations, are manifest different buddha lands. And so, World-Honored One! Bestow upon us a little Dharma, as we return to that other world, we will remember the Thus Come One.”

### The Exhaustible and Inexhaustible Liberation Dharma Door (Kṣayākṣaya Bodhisattva Vimokṣa Dharmamukha)

佛告諸菩薩：「有盡無盡解脫法門，汝等當學。何謂為盡？謂有為法；何謂無盡？謂無為法。如菩薩者，不盡有為，不住無為。

The Buddha told all the bodhisattvas, “There is the Exhaustible and Inexhaustible (*kṣayākṣaya*) Liberation Dharma Door (*dharmamukha*), which you should study. What is the exhaustible (or destructible)? Conditioned *dharma*. What is the inexhaustible (or indestructible)? Unconditioned *dharma*. To be like a bodhisattva is to not exhaust (destroy) the conditioned, and to not abide in the unconditioned.”

「何謂不盡有為？謂不離大慈，不捨大悲；深發一切智心，而不忽忘；教化眾生，終不厭倦；於四攝法，常念順行；護持正法，不惜軀命；種諸善根，無有疲厭。志常安住，方便迴向；求法不懈，說法無悋；勤供諸佛。故入生死而無所畏；於諸榮辱，心無憂喜；不輕未學，敬學如佛；墮煩惱者，令發正念，於遠離樂，不以為貴；不著己樂，慶於彼樂。在諸禪定，如地獄想；於生死中，如園觀想；見來求者，為善師想；捨諸所有，具一切智想；見毀戒人，起救護想；諸波羅蜜，為父母想；道品之法，為眷屬想。發行善根，無有齊限；以諸淨國嚴飾之事，成己佛土；行無限施，具足相好；除一切惡，淨身口意。生死無數劫，意而有勇；聞佛無量德，志而不倦。以智慧劍，破煩惱賊；出陰界入，荷負眾生，永使解脫。以大精進，摧伏魔軍，常求無念實相智慧行；於世間法少欲知足，於出世間求之無厭，而不捨世間法，不壞威儀法而能隨俗。起神通慧，引導眾生，得念總持，所聞不忘。善別諸根，斷眾生疑；以樂說辯，演法無礙。淨十善道，受天、人福；修四無量，開梵天道。勸請說法，隨喜讚善，得佛音聲；身口意善，得佛威儀。深修善法，所行轉勝；以大乘教，成菩薩僧；心無放逸，不失眾善。行如此法，是名菩薩不盡有為。

What is not exhausting (destroying) the conditioned? It is not abandoning great kindness, and not relinquishing great compassion; It is profoundly generating the aspiration for All-Knowledge and never forgetting it; It is teaching and transforming sentient beings, never growing weary; It is, in regard to the Four Means of Unification, always being mindful and in accord with them; It is protecting the Correct Dharma, not fearing for necessities; It is cultivating all good roots without becoming fatigued; It is the resolve to peacefully abide, *upaya*-ically transferring; It is seeking all Dharma without laziness, and explaining the Dharma without pedantry, and it is praising all Buddhas. Due to entering Birth & Death, it is being fearless; It is a mind without grief or joy about honor or disgrace; It is not belittling the unlearned and to revere the learned as Buddhas; It is causing those who have fallen into the afflictions to generate correct mindfulness, abandon and transcend pleasures and not consider things as rare; It is being in *dhyāna* with the perception that it is a hell realm; It is being in Birth & Death with the perception that it is a garden for observing; It is seeing someone who comes seeking with the perception that it is an excellent teacher; It is relinquishing all that exists with the perception that one is replete with All-Knowledge; It is seeing those who transgress the rules with the perception of wanting to protect them; It is perceiving the *pāramitās* as father and mother; It is perceiving the Dharmas of the elements of the Path as one’s retinue. It is generating the practice of good roots without limitations; It is having already achieved a buddha land by adorning and decorating pure lands; It is practicing limitless giving, becoming replete with [the] auspicious characteristics; It is being rid of all evil, pure in body, speech, and mind. [Throughout] immeasurable *kalpas* of birth and death, it is the Mind with courage; It is being resolved upon hearing of the immeasurable virtues of the Buddha, and never growing weary; It is defeating the bandits of the afflictions with the sword of wisdom; It is departing from the Aggregates, Realms, and Entrances, and shouldering the burden of sentient beings, ever bring them to liberation. It is defeating the armies of Mara with great *vīrya* and constantly seeking the *prajñā* practice of the True Characteristic without mindfulness; It is having little desire for worldly things (*dharmas*) and tirelessly seeking transcendent things yet without rejecting worldly things, and not destroying the dignified deportment(s) of the Dharma, therefore being in accord with them; It is bringing about super-knowledge to guide sentient beings, attaining retentive (*dhāraṇī*) memory and not forgetting [anything] heard; It is well discerning people’s faculties and cutting off their doubt; It is proclaiming the Dharma widely without obstruction by joyful eloquence; It is receiving the fortune of gods and humans from the pure Way of the Ten Excellences; It is opening the way to Brahma’s Heaven by cultivating the Four Immeasurables; It is to request explanations of the Dharma and rejoice in hearing the voice of the Buddha; It is being excellent in body, speech, and mind and attaining the dignified deportment of a buddha; It is the turning to victory from the practice of the profound cultivation of the Good Dharma; It is creating a Bodhisattva Sangha from the teachings of the Great Vehicle; It is a mind without distraction, never missing an opportunity to gather goodness. Dharma practiced like this is called the bodhisattva not exhausting the conditioned.

「何謂菩薩不住無為？謂修學空，不以空為證；修學無相、無作，不以無相、無作為證；修學無起，不以無起為證。觀於無常，而不厭善本；觀世間苦，而不惡生死；觀於無我，而誨人不倦；觀於寂滅，而不永滅；觀於遠離，而身心修善；觀無所歸，而歸趣善法；觀於無生，而以生法荷負一切；觀於無漏，而不斷諸漏；觀無所行，而以行法教化眾生；觀於空無，而不捨大悲；觀正法位，而不隨小乘；觀諸法虛妄，無牢無人、無主無相，本願未滿，而不虛福德、禪定、智慧。修如此法，是名菩薩不住無為。

“What is the bodhisattva not abiding in the unconditioned? It is studying emptiness, but not taking  emptiness to be realization; It is studying characteristiclessness and desirelessness, but not taking characteristiclessness or desirelessness to be realization; It is studying the unarisen, but not taking the unarisen to be realization. It is being observant of impermanence, yet not turned off by good roots; It is being observant of the suffering of the world, yet not considering birth and death evil; It is to be observant that there is no self, yet guiding others tirelessly; It is to be observant of quiescent cessation, yet not being forever ceased; It is to be observant of transcendence, yet the body and mind cultivate goodness; It is to be observant that there is no returning, yet returning to the Good Dharma; It is to be observant of non-origination, yet baring the burden of everything by giving rise to the Dharma; It is to be observant without any practice, yet transforming sentient beings by practicing the Dharma; It is to be observant of emptiness and nonexistence, yet not relinquishing Great Compassion; It is to be observant of the correctly established Dharma, yet not going along with the lesser vehicle; It is to be observant that all *dharmas* are empty and false, without firmness and without personhood, without a ‘chief’ and without characteristics, the original vow not yet fulfilled, yet merit, meditation, and wisdom are not in vain. Cultivating Dharma like this is called the bodhisattva not abiding in the unconditioned.”

「又具福德故，不住無為；具智慧故，不盡有為。大慈悲故，不住無為；滿本願故，不盡有為。集法藥故，不住無為；隨授藥故，不盡有為。知眾生病故，不住無為；滅眾生病故，不盡有為。諸正士菩薩以修此法，不盡有為、不住無為，是名盡無盡解脫法門，汝等當學！」

“Also, for being complete in merit, it is not abiding in the unconditioned; For being complete in wisdom, it is not extinguishing the conditioned. For great kindness and compassion, it is not abiding in the unconditioned; For the fulfillment of the original vow, it is not extinguishing the conditioned. For the accumulation of Dharma medicine, it is not abiding in the unconditioned; for administering the appropriate medicine, it is not extinguishing the conditioned. For knowing the illnesses of sentient beings, it is not abiding in the unconditioned; For extinguishing the illnesses of sentient beings, it is not extinguishing the conditioned. Proper bodhisattvas cultivating this Dharma, not extinguishing the conditioned and not abiding in the unconditioned, is called the Exhaustible and Inexhaustible Liberation Dharma Door. You should study it.”

爾時彼諸菩薩聞說是法，皆大歡喜，以眾妙華、若干種色、若干種香，散遍三千大千世界，供養於佛，及此經法，并諸菩薩已，稽首佛足，歎未曾有！言：「釋迦牟尼佛乃能於此善行方便。」言已，忽然不現，還到彼國。

At that time those bodhisattvas, having heard the explanation of this Dharma, were filled with great delight and gathered many wonderful flowers of various colors and various fragrances, scattering them throughout the Three Thousand Great Thousand world-system, offering them to the Buddha and to this sutra-dharma, as well as to the bodhisattvas, bowing their heads to the Buddha's feet and sighing at having heard what they had never heard before. They exclaimed, "Shakyamuni Buddha is able to skillfully employ *upāya*!" Having said this, they suddenly disappeared, returning to their land.
## CHAPTER TWELVE - *SEEING AKṢOBHYA BUDDHA*

見阿閦佛品第十二
Chapter Twelve: Seeing Akṣobhya Buddha

爾時世尊問維摩詰：「汝欲見如來，為以何等觀如來乎？」

At that time the World-Honored One asked Vimalakīrti, “You want[ed] to see the Thus Come One. How is the Thus Come One to be observed?”

維摩詰言：「如自觀身實相，觀佛亦然。我觀如來前際不來，後際不去，今則不住。不觀色，不觀色如，不觀色性。不觀受、想、行、識，不觀識如，不觀識性，非四大起，同於虛空。六入無積，眼、耳、鼻、舌、身、心已過；不在三界，三垢已離。順三脫門，具足三明，與無明等。不一相、不異相，不自相、不他相，非無相、非取相。不此岸，不彼岸，不中流，而化眾生。觀於寂滅，亦不永滅。不此不彼；不以此，不以彼。不可以智知，不可以識識。無晦無明，無名無相，無強無弱，非淨非穢。不在方，不離方；非有為，非無為。無示無說。不施不慳，不戒不犯，不忍不恚，不進不怠，不定不亂，不智不愚，不誠不欺，不來不去，不出不入，一切言語道斷。非福田，非不福田；非應供養，非不應供養；非取非捨。非有相，非無相。同真際，等法性。不可稱，不可量，過諸稱量。非大非小，非見非聞，非覺非知，離眾結縛。等諸智，同眾生，於諸法無分別。一切無失，無濁無惱，無作無起，無生無滅。無畏無憂，無喜無厭無著。無已有，無當有，無今有。不可以一切言說分別顯示。世尊！如來身為若此，作如是觀。以斯觀者，名為正觀；若他觀者，名為邪觀。」

Vimalakīrti said, “Like one observes the True Characteristic of their own body, [I] observe the Buddha so. I observe the Thus Come One not coming from before and not going to after, hence now not abiding. [I do] not observe Form, the semblance of Form, nor the nature of Form. Not Sensation, Perception, Conditioning, or Consciousness, nor the semblance of Consciousness or the nature of Consciousness. [I do] not observe an arising from the Four Great [Elements], being identical to Space. The six entrances are without accumulation, the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind having been surpassed; Not being in the Triple Realm, the Three Defilements being transcended. In accord with the Three Liberations, the Three Illuminations fulfilled, being equal to ignorance. Not a single characteristic, nor different characteristics, nor the characteristic of self, nor the characteristic of other, and neither without characteristics nor the characteristic of clinging [or, ‘clinging to characteristics’]. Not [on] this shore nor that shore, nor mid-stream, yet transforming sentient beings. [The Buddha is] observed to be within quiescent cessation, yet not forever ceased. Not this and not that; and not by this or by that. ****Not known by knowledge, not conscious of by consciousness. Without darkness and without brightness; Without name and without qualities (*nimitta*); Without strength and without weakness; neither pure nor defiled. Not located anywhere, [yet] not without location; Neither conditioned nor unconditioned. Indescribable and inexplicable. Not generous and not stingy; Not disciplined and not transgressive; Not patient and not angry; Not determined and not lazy; Not focused and not distracted; Not wise and not foolish; Not honest and not deceitful; Not coming and not going; Not exiting and not entering, all manners of speaking being cut off. Neither a field of blessings nor not a field of blessings. Neither worthy of offerings nor not worthy of offerings; Neither grasping nor letting go. Neither having characteristics nor being characteristicless. Identical to the Limit of Reality, equal to the nature of *dharma*. Unweighable, incalculable going beyond all weight and measure. Neither large nor small; Neither seen nor heard; Neither understood nor known, free of all ties and bondage. Equal to All-Knowledge and identical to sentient beings, not different from all *dharmas*. Everything, without loss, without impurity, without affliction, without action, without coming about, without arising, without ceasing. Without fear, without sorrow, without joy, without weariness, and without attachment. Without having been, without a will be, and without a now is. All words and explanations whatsoever cannot differentiate or demonstrate. World-Honored One! The Body of the Thus Come One being so, it is observed like this. To observe that way is called Correct Observing; To observe some other way, is called incorrect observing.”

爾時舍利弗問維摩詰：「汝於何沒而來生此？」

At that time Śāriputra inquired of Vimalakīrti saying, “Where did you die to become [re]born
here?”

維摩詰言：「汝所得法有沒生乎？」

Vimalakīrti said, “Is there dying and being [re]born in the Dharma you have attained?”

舍利弗言：「無沒生也。」

Śāriputra said, “It is without dying and being born.”

「若諸法無沒生相，云何問言：『汝於何沒而來生此？』於意云何？譬如幻師，幻作男女，寧沒生耶？」

“If all dharmas are without the characteristics of death and birth, why inquire saying, ‘Where did you die to become [re]born here?’ What do you think? Just like as an illusionist makes a man or a woman, do they die and be born?”

舍利弗言：「無沒生也。汝豈不聞佛說諸法如幻相乎？」

Śāriputra said, “They are without dying and being born. Have you not heard the Buddha say that the characteristics of all *dharmas* are illusory?”

答曰：「如是！若一切法如幻相者！云何問言：『汝於何沒而來生此？』舍利弗！沒者為虛誑法，敗壞之相；生者為虛誑法，相續之相。菩薩雖沒，不盡善本；雖生，不長諸惡。」

[Vimalakīrti] replied saying, “So it is! If the characteristics of all dharmas are illusory, why inquire saying, ‘Where did you die to become [re]born here?’! Śāriputra! Death is the characteristic of the destruction of fallacious *dharmas*; Birth is the characteristic of the continuity of fallacious *dharmas*. A bodhisattva may die without extinguishing their good roots; though they may be born, they do not prolong evil.”

是時佛告舍利弗：「有國名妙喜，佛號無動。是維摩詰於彼國沒，而來生此。」

Then the Buddha said to Śāriputra, “There is a land called Wondrous Joy (Abhirati), where the Buddha is called Imperturbable ([Akṣobhya](https://www.notion.so/Ak-obhya-Buddha-535f55c373e849d2b2f3eeb3024b3f2b?pvs=21)). This Vimalakīrti died in that land and came to be born like this.”

舍利弗言：「未曾有也。世尊！是人乃能捨清淨土，而來樂此多怒害處。」

Śāriputra said, “Unprecedented, World-Honored One! This person is able to relinquish such a pure land and gladly come to this place of so much anger and harm.”

維摩詰語舍利弗：「於意云何？日光出時與冥合乎？」

Vimalakīrti said to Śāriputra, “What do you think?  When the light of the sun shines forth, does it mix with the darkness?"

答曰：「不也！日光出時，即無眾冥。」

[Śāriputra] replied saying, “No! When the light of the sun shines forth, it does not mix with the darkness?

維摩詰言：「夫日何故行閻浮提？」

Vimalakīrti said, “Why does the sun come to Jambudvipa?”

答曰：「欲以明照，為之除冥。」

[Śāriputra] replied saying, “It wants to eliminate darkness by illumination.”

維摩詰言：「菩薩如是！雖生不淨佛土，為化眾生故，不與愚闇而共合也，但滅眾生煩惱闇耳！」

Vimalakīrti said, “Bodhisattvas are also like this. Although they are born in impure Buddha lands, it is in order to transform sentient beings. They do not go along with the darkness of stupidity and are not part of it, they merely extinguish the darkness of the afflictions of sentient beings!”

是時大眾渴仰，欲見妙喜世界無動如來，及其菩薩、聲聞之眾。佛知一切眾會所念，告維摩詰言：「善男子！為此眾會，現妙喜國無動如來，及諸菩薩、聲聞之眾，眾皆欲見。」’

At that time the great assembly was filled with a longing desire to the see the Imperturbable Thus Come One of the world-system Wondrous Joy, the bodhisattvas there, and the gathering of voice-hearers. The Buddha, knowing the thoughts of all those assembled, told Vimalakīrti, “Good son! For those gathered together, make appear the Thus Come One Imperturbable of the World Wondrous Joy, and all the bodhisattvas, and the gathering of voice-hearers.”

於是維摩詰心念：「吾當不起于座，接妙喜國，鐵圍山川溪谷江河，大海泉源，須彌諸山，及日月星宿、天龍鬼神梵天等宮，并諸菩薩、聲聞之眾，城邑聚落，男女大小，乃至無動如來，及菩提樹，諸妙蓮華，能於十方作佛事者；三道寶階從閻浮提，至忉利天，以此寶階，諸天來下，悉為禮敬無動如來，聽受經法。閻浮提人，亦登其階，上昇忉利，見彼諸天。妙喜世界成就如是無量功德，上至阿迦膩吒天，下至水際；以右手斷取，如陶家輪，入此世界，猶持華鬘，示一切眾。」作是念已，入於三昧，現神通力，以其右手斷取妙喜世界，置於此土。

At this, Vimalakīrti thought, “Without rising from my seat, I shall take this land Wonderful Joy, with its Iron Encircling Mountains and rivers, its valleys, waterways, great oceans, and springs, its Sumeru and other mountains, along with its sun, moon, stars, and palaces of devas, nagas, spirits, Brahmas and Indras, as well as its host of bodhisattvas and gathering of voice-hearers, its cities, villages, men and women, old and young, along with the Thus Come One Imperturbable and the bodhi tree and wonderful lotus blossoms that are able to carry out the Buddha's work in the ten directions; The jeweled staircases of the ‘three paths’ from Jambudvipa up to the *Trāyastriṃśa* Heaven, the jeweled stairways by which devas descend and all pay reverence to the Thus Come One Imperturbable and listen to and receive the Dharma of the sutras; People of Jambudvipa may also ascend these stairways to the *Trāyastriṃśa* Heaven and see the devas; The immeasurable merits achieved in the world-system Wonderous Joy such as these, extending upward to the Akaniṣṭha Heaven and downward to its watery base; taking [that] in my right hand, as though removing a finished piece from a potter's wheel, and bring it to this world, like a flower garland I am holding, and show it to all these beings,"

After having this thought, he entered samadhi, manifesting penetrative spiritual power, taking in his right hand the world-system Wonderous Joy, as though removing it from a potter's wheel, putting it in this land.”

彼得神通菩薩及聲聞眾，并餘天、人，俱發聲言：「唯然世尊！誰取我去！願見救護。」無動佛言：「非我所為，是維摩詰神力所作。」其餘未得神通者，不覺不知己之所往。妙喜世界，雖入此土，而不增減，於是世界亦不迫隘，如本無異。

Those bodhisattvas and voice-hearers gathered who had attained spiritual powers, and all the devas and humans together cried out saying, “What is it, World-Honored One! Who is taking us away! Please, protect us.”

Imperturbable Buddha said, “It is not my doing, it is from the spiritual power of Vimalakīrti.”

The rest of the beings who had not yet acquired spiritual powers did not even realize or know where they had gotten to. Although the Wonderous Joy world-system had been placed in this land, there was no increase or decrease, and this world likewise had in no way become cramped or narrow, no different from how it originally was.

爾時釋迦牟尼佛告諸大眾：「汝等且觀妙喜世界無動如來，其國嚴飾，菩薩行淨，弟子清白。」

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha told the great assembly, “Did you observe the Thus Come One Imperturbable of the Wondrous Joy world-system, the ornamentations of that country, the pure practices of the bodhisattvas, and purity of the disciples?”

皆曰：「唯然已見。」

[They] replied saying, “We have seen.”

佛言：「若菩薩欲得如是清淨佛土，當學無動如來所行之道。」

The Buddha said, “If bodhisattvas want to attain pure Buddha lands like this, they should study the Way practiced by the Thus Come One Imperturbable.”

現此妙喜國時，娑婆世界十四那由他人，發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，皆願生於妙喜佛土。釋迦牟尼佛即記之曰：「當生彼國。」時妙喜世界於此國土所應饒益，其事訖已，還復本處，舉眾皆見。

When this world Wonderous Joy was made manifest, fourteen *nayutas* of people in the Saha world-system generated *anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi citta*, all desiring to be [re]born in the Wonderous Joy Buddha Land. Śākyamuni Buddha then made the prediction, “You will be [re] born there.” Then the world Wonderous Joy, having finished bestowing enrichment and benefit upon this land, returned to its original location, and all the members saw it do so.”

佛告舍利弗：「汝見此妙喜世界及無動佛不？」

The Buddha told Śāriputra, “Did you see the Wonderous Joy world-system and the Buddha Imperturbable?”

「唯然已見，世尊！願使一切眾生得清淨土，如無動佛；獲神通力，如維摩詰。世尊！我等快得善利，得見是人親近供養。其諸眾生，若今現在，若佛滅後，聞此經者，亦得善利；況復聞已信解，受持讀誦解說，如法修行。若有手得是經典者，便為已得法寶之藏；若有讀誦解釋其義，如說修行，即為諸佛之所護念；其有供養如是人者，當知即為供養於佛；其有書持此經卷者，當知其室即有如來；若聞是經能隨喜者，斯人即為取一切智；若能信解此經，乃至一四句偈，為他說者，當知此人，即是受阿耨多羅三藐三菩提記。」

“I saw them, World-Honored One! I wish that every sentient being attains a pure land like that of the Buddha Imperturbable; that they obtain spiritually penetrative power like Vimalakīrti.”

“World-Honored One! We have quickly attained good benefit, seeing this person and making offerings directly to him. Those sentient beings who, either now presently or after the Buddha’s cessation, hear this sutra, they will also attain good benefit. How much more so if, after hearing it, they are liberated by faith, accepting, reciting, explaining, and practicing according to it! Those whose hands get to hold this sutra will attain the entire storehouse of Dharma Jewels. If one reads, recites, explains its meaning, and practices according to what it means, one will be protected and remembered by the buddhas. To make offerings to such a person, you should know, is to make offerings to a Buddha. To copy and maintain copies of sutras, you should know, is to be in the company of the Thus Come One. To hear this sutra and become joyful accordingly will achieve omniscience. To have faith in this sutra, even just four lines, and explain it to others, you should know, this person receives the prediction of *anuttarā samyak-saṃbodhi*.”
## CHAPTER THIRTEEN - *DHARMA OFFERINGS*

法供養品第十三
Chapter Thirteen - *Dharma Offerings*

爾時釋提桓因於大眾中白佛言：「世尊！我雖從佛及文殊師利聞百千經，未曾聞此不可思議，自在神通，決定實相經典。如我解佛所說義趣，若有眾生聞是經法，信解受持讀誦之者，必得是法不疑，何況如說修行？斯人即為閉眾惡趣開諸善門，常為諸佛之所護念；降伏外學，摧滅魔怨；修治菩提，安處道場；履踐如來所行之跡。世尊！若有受持讀誦如說修行者，我當與諸眷屬供養給事；所在聚落城邑、山林曠野，有是經處，我亦與諸眷屬，聽受法故共到其所；其未信者，當令生信；其已信者，當為作護。」

At that time, Śakra Devānām Indra, who was in the great congregation, addressed the Buddha saying, “World-honored One! Though I have heard hundreds and thousands of sutras from the Buddha and Mañjuśrī, I have never heard one with such inconceivable, sovereign spiritual power,
and such definitive grasp of True Thusness. According to my understanding of what the Buddha has just said, if there are living beings who hear this sutra on the Dharma, believe and understand it,
accept and uphold it, read and recite it, then they will surely and without doubt acquire that Dharma. How much more so if they practice as the Dharma directs. Such people will shut off all evil paths of existence and open the gates to all good ones. They will be constantly guarded and kept in mind by the Buddhas; will refute outside teachings and overcome the animosity of Mara; will cultivate and practice *bodhi*, and abide at the site of enlightenment; following in the way trod by the Thus Come One. World-Honored One! If there are people who accept and uphold, read and recite this sutra and practice it as the Dharma directs, then I and my followers will offer alms to them and serve them. And if there is a place among the villages or towns, the mountain forests or the broad plains where this sutra exists, then I and my followers will go there together to listen to and accept the Dharma; and those who do not yet believe in it I will lead to belief, and to those who already believe I will

be a guardian.”

佛言：「善哉，善哉！天帝！如汝所說，吾助爾喜。此經廣說過去、未來、現在諸佛不可思議阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。是故，天帝！若善男子、善女人，受持、讀誦、供養是經者，即為供養去、來、今佛。

The Buddha said, “Excellent! Excellent! Heavenly Lord! It is as you have said, and I will assist you in your joyful task. This sutra broadly explains the inconceivable *anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi* of all buddhas of the past, future, and present. Therefore, Heavenly Lord! If good men and good women are able to receive, retain, read, and recite, and make offerings to this sutra, it is the same as making offerings to past, future, and present buddhas.”

「天帝！正使三千大千世界如來滿中，譬如甘蔗、竹[竺-二+韋]、稻麻、叢林；若有善男子、善女人，或一劫、或減一劫，恭敬尊重，讚歎供養，奉諸所安，至諸佛滅後，以一一全身舍利起七寶塔，縱廣一四天下，高至梵天，表剎莊嚴；以一切華香、瓔珞、幢幡、伎樂微妙第一，若一劫、若減一劫，而供養之。於天帝意云何，其人植福，寧為多不？」

“Heavenly Lord, suppose this Three Thousand Great Thousand World-System were as full of Thus Come Ones as it is of sugarcane, bamboo, reeds, rice and hemp plants, or forest trees. If there were good men or good women who for the span of a *kalpa*, or less than a *kalpa*, were to revere and honor, praise and make offerings to them and provide for their well-being; and if after those Buddhas had passed away, these people built towers adorned with the seven treasures to house the relics from each Buddha body, towers so broad they covered the four continents and so high they
reached to the Brahma heaven, their central pole richly decorated; and if these people made offerings of all kinds of flowers, incense, necklaces, flags, pennants, and music, all of the most
refined and wonderful kind, and did this for the span of a *kalpa*, or less than a *kalpa*—Heavenly Lord, what do you think? Would these people have thereby planted the seeds of much merit, or not?"

釋提桓因言：「多矣，世尊！彼之福德，若以百千億劫，說不能盡。」

Śakra Devānām Indra said, “Much indeed, World-Honored One! A hundred thousand million
*kalpas* of explanation could never finish describing all that merit.”

佛告天帝：「當知是善男子、善女人，聞是不可思議解脫經典，信解受持，讀誦修行，福多於彼。所以者何？諸佛菩提皆從是生；菩提之相不可限量，以是因緣福不可量。」

The Buddha told the Heavenly Lord, “You should know, good men and good women who hear this sutra on the Inconceivable Liberation and have faith in it, understand, receive, retain, read, recite and practice it, the merit will be greater than that. How so? Because the *bodhi* of the Buddhas is all born from this sutra. The characteristic of *bodhi* is beyond limit or measure, and for that reason the merit is immeasurable."

佛告天帝：「過去無量阿僧祇劫，時世有佛，號曰藥王如來、應供、正遍知、明行足、善逝、世間解、無上士、調御丈夫、天人師、佛、世尊。世界名大莊嚴，劫曰莊嚴，佛壽二十小劫；其聲聞僧三十六億那由他；菩薩僧有十二億。天帝！是時有轉輪聖王，名曰寶蓋，七寶具足，主四天下。王有千子，端正勇健，能伏怨敵。

The Buddha told the Heavenly Lord, “Immeasurable *asamkhya* *kalpas* in the past, there was
a Buddha in the world named Medicine King, Thus Come One, Worthy of Offerings, of right and universal knowledge, perfect clarity and conduct, well gone, understanding the world, unexcelled
noble, trainer of people, teacher of gods and humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. The world was called Great Adornment and the *kalpa* was called Adornment. This Buddha had a life span of twenty small *kalpas*. The *śrāvaka* monks numbered thirty-six million *nayutas* and bodhisattva
monks were twelve million. Heavenly Noble! At that time there was a wheel-turning sage
king named Jeweled Parasol, replete with the seven treasures, ruler of the four continents. This king
had a thousand children, all upright, valiant, and capable of overpowering their enemies.”

「爾時寶蓋與其眷屬供養藥王如來，施諸所安，至滿五劫。過五劫已，告其千子：『汝等亦當如我，以深心供養於佛。』於是千子受父王命，供養藥王如來，復滿五劫，一切施安。其王一子，名曰月蓋，獨坐思惟：『寧有供養殊過此者？』以佛神力，空中有天曰：『善男子！法之供養勝諸供養。』即問：『何謂法之供養？』天曰：『汝可往問藥王如來，當廣為汝說法之供養。』

At that time Jeweled Parasol came with his retinue to make offerings to the Medicine King Thus Come One, providing him with all he needed for his well-being. He did this for five whole *kalpas.* After five *kalpas* had passed, he said to his thousand children, 'You too should make offerings as I have to the Buddha, with the same profound mind. The thousand children, obeying their father's command, proceeded to make offerings to the Medicine King Thus Come One for another five full *kalpas*, providing him with everything needed for his well-being. One child of the king named Moon Parasol sat all alone, thinking, 'Isn't there some offering that is better than these?' Then, by the spiritual power of the Buddha, a deva appeared in the sky and said, 'Kulaputra! The offering of the Dharma is the finest of all offerings!' The child asked, 'What is offering the Dharma?' The deva replied, 'You should go and ask the Medicine King Thus Come One. He will explain to you in detail offering the Dharma.'

「即時月蓋王子行詣藥王如來，稽首佛足，却住一面，白佛言：『世尊！諸供養中，法供養勝。云何為法供養？』佛言：『善男子！法供養者，諸佛所說深經，一切世間難信難受，微妙難見，清淨無染，非但分別思惟之所能得。菩薩法藏所攝，陀羅尼印印之。至不退轉，成就六度，善分別義，順菩提法，眾經之上。入大慈悲，離眾魔事，及諸邪見。順因緣法，無我，無人，無眾生，無壽命，空、無相、無作、無起。能令眾生坐於道場，而轉法輪，諸天、龍神、乾闥婆等，所共歎譽。能令眾生入佛法藏，攝諸賢聖一切智慧。說眾菩薩所行之道，依於諸法實相之義。明宣無常、苦、空、無我、寂滅之法，能救一切毀禁眾生；諸魔外道及貪著者，能使怖畏；諸佛賢聖所共稱歎。背生死苦，示涅槃樂，十方三世諸佛所說。若聞如是等經，信解受持讀誦，以方便力，為諸眾生分別解說，顯示分明，守護法故，是名法之供養。又於諸法如說修行，隨順十二因緣，離諸邪見，得無生忍；決定無我無有眾生，而於因緣果報無違無諍，離諸我所。依於義，不依語；依於智，不依識；依了義經，不依不了義經；依於法，不依人。隨順法相，無所入，無所歸。無明畢竟滅故，諸行亦畢竟滅；乃至生畢竟滅故，老死亦畢竟滅。作如是觀，十二因緣，無有盡相，不復起見，是名最上法之供養。』」

"Then the king’s child Moon Parasol went to visit the Medicine King Thus Come One, bowed his head to the Buddha's feet, stood to one side and addressed the Buddha, saying, 'World-Honored One! Among all offerings, the offering of the Dharma is the finest. But what is offering the Dharma?' The Buddha said, 'Kulaputa! Offering the Dharma means all the profound sutras spoken by the Buddhas, which are difficult to believe and difficult to accept throughout all worldly realms, for they are wonderfully subtle and difficult to see, clean and pure, without stain, incapable of being grasped by making distinctions or through thought. They are contained within the Dharma Treasury of the Bodhisattvas and sealed with the *dharani* seal. They lead to non-regression and the accomplishment of the Six Paramitas, skillful discrimination of meaning, and conformity with *bodhi* Dharma, the highest of all the classics (sutras). They lead to great kindness and compassion, freedom from the activities of Māra and all false views. They conform with the Dharmas of dependent-origination, the absence of self, the absence of individuality, the absence of sentience, the absence of life-span, emptiness, characteristiclessness, aimlessness, and non-origination. They are able to cause sentient beings to sit upon the site of enlightenment, to turn the Dharma Wheel, and they are praised by all the devas, nagas, spirits, gandharvas, and so on. They are able to make sentient beings enter the treasury of Buddha-Dharma, and embrace all the wisdom of worthies and sages. They explain the path practiced by the host of bodhisattvas dependent upon the meaning of the True Characteristic of dharmas. They illuminate the dharmas of impermanence, suffering, emptiness, no-self, and cessation, and they are able to save all sentient beings who are transgressive. They can render afraid the Māras, heretics, and those attached to desire. They are praised by all the buddhas, worthies, and sages. They reject the suffering of birth & death and reveal the joy of Nirvana, as explained by all the buddhas of the ten directions and three periods of time. If one hears such sutras, and devoutly understands, accepts and maintains, and reads and recites them, will, with the power of *upaya,* explain them clearly and with discriminative understanding for sentient beings. This is because that person will be maintaining and protecting the Dharma. This is called ‘offering the Dharma.’ Furthermore, when one practices the Dharma as explained, one will be in accord with the twelve [links of] dependent-origination, transcend false views, and attain the patient tolerance of the birthlessness of dharmas. There definitively being no self and no sentient beings, therefore there is no disagreement, no contention with the results of dependent-origination, transcending all the aspects of a self. Reliant upon meaning, not upon words. Reliant upon wisdom, not upon consciousness. Reliant upon sutras of comprehensive meaning, not upon sutras of incomplete meaning. Reliant upon the Dharma, not upon people. Being in accord with the characteristics of *dharmas*, without anywhere to enter, without any refuge. Because ignorance is thoroughly extinguished, all conditioning (*saṃskāra*) is thoroughly extinguished. Because birth, as well, is thoroughly extinguished, old age and death are thoroughly extinguished. Observing like this, the twelve [links of] dependent-origination are without the characteristic of exhaustion, no longer giving rise to views, this is called the supreme ‘offering the Dharma.’

佛告天帝：「王子月蓋從藥王佛聞如是法，得柔順忍。即解寶衣嚴身之具，以供養佛，白佛言：『世尊！如來滅後，我當行法供養，守護正法。願以威神加哀建立，令我得降魔怨，修菩薩行。』佛知其深心所念，而記之曰：『汝於末後，守護法城。』天帝！時王子月蓋，見法清淨，聞佛授記，以信出家，修集善法；精進不久，得五神通，逮菩薩道，得陀羅尼，無斷辯才。於佛滅後，以其所得神通、總持、辯才之力，滿十小劫，藥王如來所轉法輪隨而分布。月蓋比丘以守護法，勤行精進，即於此身，化百萬億人於阿耨多羅三藐三菩提，立不退轉；十四那由他人，深發聲聞、辟支佛心；無量眾生得生天上。天帝！時王寶蓋豈異人乎？今現得佛，號寶炎如來；其王千子，即賢劫中千佛是也。從迦羅鳩孫駄為始得佛，最後如來號曰樓至。月蓋比丘，即我身是。如是，天帝！當知此要，以法供養於諸供養為上為最，第一無比。是故天帝！當以法之供養，供養於佛。」

The Buddha told the Heavenly Lord, “The king’s child Moon Canopy, hearing this Dharma from Medicine King Buddha, attained conforming patience. Taking off his jeweled robe and bodily ornaments, he offered them to the Buddha, saying ‘World-honored One! After the extinction of the Thus Come One, I will practice ‘offering the Dharma’ and protect the correct Dharma. Please
use your majestic power compassionately, so that I will be able to tame the vengeful Māras and cultivate the practices of bodhisattvas.’ The buddha, knowing the profound thoughts in [the child’s] mind, made this prediction, “In times to come, you will protect the City of Dharma.”

“Heavenly Lord! The king’s child Moon Canopy then saw the purity of the Dharma. Hearing the Buddha bestow this prediction, he developed faith and left home. After cultivating the good Dharma with exertion for not very long, he attained the five spiritual powers and became a bodhisattva. He attained *dhāraṇīs* and unending eloquence. After the extinction of that buddha, using those spiritual powers, *dhāraṇīs*, and power of eloquence, he disseminated the wheel of the Dharma that Medicine King Buddha had turned for a full ten short *kalpas*. Through his diligent practice and exertion in protecting the Dharma, in that lifetime Moon Canopy bhikṣu converted a
million *koṭis* of people irreversibly to *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. Fourteen *nayutas* of people generated the profound inspiration to become *śrāvakas* and *pratyekabuddhas*. Immeasurable sentient beings gained birth in the heavens. Heavenly Lord! What kind of person was King Jeweled Canopy of that time? As of now they have attained buddhahood and are called Jewel Mirage Thus Come One. Those thousand children of the king became the thousand buddhas of the Bhadrakalpa (’Worthy Kalpa’). The first achieved buddhahood as Krakucchandra, and the last will be the Thus Come One named Ruci (’Bright and Splendorous’). Moon Canopy bhikṣu was I myself. Therefore, Heavenly Lord, you should understand this essential point: offering the Dharma excels all other offerings. It is supreme, incomparable. Therefore, Heavenly Lord, you should use the offering of the Dharma to make offerings to the buddhas.”
## CHAPTER FOURTEEN - *ENTRUSTMENT*

囑累品第十四
Chapter Fourteen - *Entrustment*

於是佛告彌勒菩薩言：「彌勒！我今以是無量億阿僧祇劫所集阿耨多羅三藐三菩提法，付囑於汝。如是輩經，於佛滅後末世之中，汝等當以神力，廣宣流布於閻浮提，無令斷絕。所以者何？未來世中，當有善男子、善女人，及天、龍、鬼神、乾闥婆、羅剎等，發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，樂于大法；若使不聞如是等經，則失善利。如此輩人，聞是等經，必多信樂，發希有心，當以頂受，隨諸眾生所應得利，而為廣說。

At this time, the Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva, “Maitreya! I now bestow upon you this Dharma of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*, which I have accumulated over immeasurable *koṭis* of *asaṃkhyeyas* of *kalpas*. Sutras of this kind should, during the final period after my Nirvana, be circulated extensively throughout Jambudvīpa by you and others with your spiritual power so as not to be cut off. Why? In a future time, there will be good men and good women, as well as devas, nagas, ghosts and spirits, gandharvas, rakṣasas, and so on, who will generate *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi citta* and take pleasure in the great Dharma. If they are unable to hear a sutra such as this, they will lose its good benefit. When these type of people hear these sutras, they must with great faith and joy realize their rarity and accept them with humility, explaining them extensively according to the benefits that sentient beings will receive from them.”

「彌勒當知！菩薩有二相。何謂為二？一者，好於雜句文飾之事；二者，不畏深義如實能入。若好雜句文飾事者，當知是為新學菩薩；若於如是無染無著甚深經典，無有恐畏，能入其中，聞已心淨，受持讀誦，如說修行，當知是為久修道行。

“Maitreya, you should know! Bodhisattvas have two characteristics. What are these two? 1. They are good with miscellaneous phrases and literary embellishments; and 2. Their lack of fear of penetrating deeply into the actualities of profound meaning. You should know that it is novice bodhisattvas who are good with miscellaneous phrases and literary embellishment. Those who lack the fear of entering into profound sutras that are without defilement and without attachment, and who upon hearing them become pure in mind and accept and maintain, read and recite, and practice them as explained—you should understand that these [bodhisattvas] have been cultivating the path for a long time.”

「彌勒！復有二法，名新學者，不能決定於甚深法。何等為二？一者，所未聞深經，聞之驚怖生疑，不能隨順，毀謗不信，而作是言：『我初不聞。從何所來？』二者，若有護持解說如是深經者，不肯親近、供養、恭敬，或時於中說其過惡。有此二法，當知是為新學菩薩，為自毀傷，不能於深法中，調伏其心。

“Maitreya! There are two things (*dharmas*) regarding how those who are called novices unable to be definite about the extremely profound Dharma. What are these two? 1. When they hear profound sutras for the first time, they become fearful, generate doubt, and are unable to follow them. Reviling them and lacking faith in them, they say ‘I have not heard this before. Where did it come from?’; and 2. When there are those who defend, maintain, and explain profound sutras such as these, they are unable to associate with them, make offerings to them, and revere them. Or, at times they talk about their transgressions and errors. You should know, those who have these two things are novice bodhisattvas. They only harm themselves, and they are unable to control their minds within the profound Dharma.”

「彌勒！復有二法，菩薩雖信解深法，猶自毀傷，而不能得無生法忍。何等為二？一者，輕慢新學菩薩，而不教誨；二者，雖解深法，而取相分別。是為二法。」

“Maitreya! There are also two other things concerning bodhisattvas who devoutly understand the profound Dharma, but who still harm themselves and are unable to attain the patient tolerance for the birthlessness of dharmas. What are these two? 1. They belittle novice bodhisattvas and do not instruct them; and 2. They understand the profound Dharma, but with a discrimination that grasps at characteristics. These are the two things.”

彌勒菩薩聞說是已，白佛言：「世尊！未曾有也。如佛所說，我當遠離如斯之惡，奉持如來無數阿僧祇劫所集阿耨多羅三藐三菩提法。若未來世善男子、善女人求大乘者，當令手得如是等經，與其念力，使受持讀誦、為他廣說。世尊！若後末世，有能受持讀誦、為他說者，當知皆是彌勒神力之所建立。」

When Maitreya Bodhisattva heard this explanation he addressed the Buddha saying, “World-Honored One! This is unprecedented. It is as you have explained. I will far transcend such evils and maintain the Dharma of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi* that the Thus Come One has accumulated over innumerable *asaṃkhyeyas* of *kalpas*. If, in the future, there are good men and good women who seek the Great Vehicle, I will make certain that they get hold of such sutras. Using their power of mindfulness, I will cause them to receive and maintain, read and recite, and extensively explain them for others. World-honored One! If, in latter times, there are those able to receive, maintain, read, recite, and explain them for others, one should understand that these will all be established by Maitreya’s spiritual power.”

佛言：「善哉，善哉！彌勒！如汝所說，佛助爾喜。」

The Buddha said, “Excellent, excellent! Maitreya! It is just as you have explained. I am delighted!”

於是一切菩薩合掌白佛：「我等亦於如來滅後，十方國土廣宣流布阿耨多羅三藐三菩提法，復當開導諸說法者，令得是經。」

At this all the bodhisattvas held their palms together and addressed the Buddha, “We too, after the Buddha’s nirvana, will extensively disseminate the Dharma of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi* throughout the lands of the ten directions. We will also guide those who explain the Dharma and cause them to obtain this sutra.”

爾時四天王白佛言：「世尊！在在處處、城邑聚落、山林曠野，有是經卷，讀誦解說者，我當率諸官屬，為聽法故，往詣其所，擁護其人，面百由旬，令無伺求得其便者。」

Then the four heavenly kings addressed the Buddha saying, “World-honored One! In every place where there are those who read and recite and explain the chapters of this sutra, whether city, village, mountain forest, or wilderness, we will lead our palace retinues to those places to listen to the Dharma and protect those people. For an area of a hundred *yojanas* we will make it convenient to find without seeking.”

是時佛告阿難：「受持是經，廣宣流布。」

At this time the Buddha said to Ānanda, “Accept and maintain this sutra, and disseminate it extensively.”

阿難言：「唯然！我已受持要者。世尊！當何名斯經？」

Ānanda said, “So shall it be! I have already accepted and maintained its essentials. World-honored One! What is the name of this sutra?”

佛言：「阿難！是經名為『維摩詰所說』，亦名『不可思議解脫法門』，如是受持。」

The Buddha said, “Ānanda! This sutra is called the ‘Discourse of Vimalakīrti.’ It is also called the ‘Inconceivable Liberation Dharma Door.’ As such you should accept and maintain it.”

佛說是經已，長者維摩詰、文殊師利、舍利弗、阿難等，及諸天、人、阿修羅一切大眾，聞佛所說，皆大歡喜。

When the Buddha finished explaining this sutra, the Elder Vimalakīrti, Mañjuśrī, Śāriputra, Ānanda, and all the great congregations of devas, humans, and asuras, hearing what the Buddha had explained, were all greatly pleased.
